        <p>Hello, I’m Varun 🖖🏼</p> 
        <p>I head product design at <a href="http://innovaccer.com" target="_blank">Innovaccer</a>, where I get to work
          with an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/innovaccerdsgn" target="_blank">incredible design team</a>. Areas of interest include design, science fiction, space, and philosophy.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, I share <a href="/gallery.html">pictures</a> from travel.</p><br/>

        <p>I am a major in Computer Science but always had a knack for making things easy to use.
          Mostly self-taught in design - I learned the nitty-gritties of design by trial and error.</p>

        <p>I’m looking for a mentor, but would love to help out young designers and
          developers with whatever I can.</p>

        <p>Definitely reach out to me if you are seeing this! 🙌</p>
