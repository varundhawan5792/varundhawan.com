[A conversation with Jony Ive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLb9g_8r-mE&t=679s) at the Stripe Sessions, 2025.

- **Design is a moral act.**  
_“What we make stands testament to who we are. And what we make describes our values. It describes our preoccupations.”_  
Products are public statements of the maker’s values; care and craftsmanship signal respect for people, while carelessness signals the opposite. _“You sense carelessness. And so I think it's reasonable to believe that you also know care and you sense care.”_

- **Purpose beats disruption.**  
_“I have no interest in breaking stuff for the sake of breaking stuff… Breaking stuff and moving on quickly leaves us surrounded by carnage. I’m interested if things get broken as a consequence of actually creating something better.”_  
Innovation that truly advances humanity matters; change that exists only to disrupt is wasteful and cynical.

- **Simplicity must still have a soul.**  
_“One of the mistakes that people make is that they think simple products… means you just end up with an uncluttered product, but a kind of desiccated, soulless product.”_  
Removing clutter is only half the job; simplicity should express purpose, joy, and humanity, not just minimalism for its own sake.

- **People feel invisible details.**  
_“When somebody unwrapped that box and took out that cable and they thought somebody gave a damn about me, I think that's a spiritual thing.”_  
_“A great cabinet maker finishes the back of a drawer, even though it's unlikely it will be seen… It's a mark of how evolved we are as people. It’s what we do when no one sees.”_  
Finishing hidden elements and making everyday interactions delightful build an emotional bond because users sense when someone genuinely cares.

- **Measure what matters, and accept that some essentials resist metrics.**  
_“We spend all our time talking about attributes because we can easily measure them. Therefore, this is all that matters. And that's a lie.”_  
_“Delight, joy, trust… these things are harder to measure, but they are crucial.”_  
Teams focus on what’s quantifiable (cost, weight, deadlines) but the intangibles (joy, trust, delight) are just as vital for success.

- **Small, trusting teams unlock fragile ideas.**  
_“A small team of people that really trust each other is fundamentally important.”_  
_“I've missed amazing ideas that came from a quiet place, from a quiet person. That really scares me because I don’t know what I’ve missed.”_  
Creativity thrives when colleagues feel safe, listen more than they speak, and perform rituals like making breakfast for each other to deepen trust and vulnerability.

- **Opinions kill ideas.**  
_“People are just desperate to express an opinion. And let's be very clear—opinions aren't ideas.”_  
_“Everybody has opinions. It just doesn't mean every opinion has the same weight.”_  
When people rush to voice opinions often crush delicate, unformed ideas before they can be explored. Experience and mastery lend certain voices more weight in design conversations.

- **Environment shapes thinking.**  
_“Of course you think differently when you're sat in someone's living room.”_  
_“If you're designing for people and you're in someone's living room, sat on their sofa, or sat on their floor… your mind wanders differently than if you're sat in a typical corporate conference room.”_  
The spaces where ideas are born shape their outcomes; real-world settings inspire more human-centered solutions.

- **Speed, quality, and cost can coexist if motivation is clear.**  
_“I would get belligerent and say no, we don't have to choose. We can do both… It’s very hard, but it's possible if we work wonderfully efficiently.”_  
Efficiency is noble when it protects quality; shortcuts born of impatience erode both product and culture.

- **Own the downsides of what you build.**  
_“Even if you're innocent in your intention, if you're involved in something with poor consequences, you need to own it.”_  
A principled maker acknowledges and mitigates harm, rather than hiding behind good intentions. _“That ownership… has driven a lot of what I've been working on.”_

- **Progress outpaces regulation and reflection.**  
_“We are moving so fast… the discussion comes far too late.”_  
Technological waves (from the Industrial Revolution to AI) arrive faster than society’s ability to absorb them, so creators must inject their own guardrails and ethical pauses.

- **Joy and humor are competitive advantages.**  
_“I think joy and humor have been missing in the Valley… If I’m consumed with anxiety, that’s how the work will end up.”_  
Products that feel optimistic and playful gain traction, because people return to experiences that lift their mood.

- **Work equals love in practice.**  
_“Freud said, you know, all there is, all there is is love and work. Work and love. That’s all there is.”_  
_“If we spend our time working without caring about other people, we suffer. That’s a corrosive existence.”_  
Devoting most waking hours to projects that ignore human well-being corrodes both maker and user; caring is not optional, it’s the essence of meaningful labor.
