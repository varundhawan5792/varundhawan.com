## Shruti vs. Smriti

### 1. Shruti (that which is heard)
- _Shruti_ refers to sacred texts considered directly revealed or divinely inspired, including the **Vedas** and **Upanishads**.
- These texts were "heard" by ancient sages (_rishis_) in deep meditation and passed down orally.
- Characteristics: eternal, unalterable, not of human authorship, and foundational scriptural authority in Hinduism.

### 2. Smriti (that which is remembered)
- _Smriti_ texts are of human authorship, though often divinely inspired.
- They interpret, recall, or elaborate on _Shruti_ teachings.
- Examples: **Mahabharata**, **Ramayana**, **Puranas**, **Dharmashastras**, and the **Bhagavad Gita**.

## The Vedas

- Oldest, most sacred Hinduism texts, considered **eternal and divinely revealed**.
- "Heard" by Rishis during deep meditations and passed down orally.
- Rishis are seen as receivers or discoverers of divine knowledge, not authors.
- Four major vedic collections:
	- **Rigveda**: Hymns of praise, one of the oldest religious texts.
	- **Yajurveda**: Focuses on rituals and sacrifices.
	- **Samaveda**: Primarily liturgical and musical.
	- **Atharvaveda**: Contains hymns, spells, and incantations.

## The Upanishads

- Philosophical texts usually at the "end" of the Vedas.
- Focus on deeper spiritual and philosophical questions about reality, self (_Atman_), and ultimate truth (_Brahman_).
- Considered _Shruti_, "heard" by sages in meditation, not composed by humans.
- Notable sages associated with Upanishads:
	- **Yajnavalkya**: Featured in the _Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanishad_.
	- **Uddalaka Aruni** and **Shvetaketu**: Appear in the _Chandogya Upanishad_.

## The Brahma Sutras

- Concise *sutras* (aphorisms) that **systematize and interpret the teachings of the Upanishads** and reconcile any seeming contradictions.
- Explores the nature of ultimate reality (_Brahman_) and how it relates to the individual self (_Atman_) and the world.
- Attributed to the sage **Bādarāyaṇa.**
- One of the three foundational texts of _Vedānta_, along with the **Upanishads** and the **Bhagavad Gita**.

## Vedānta

- Major school of Indian philosophy focused on the **end or culmination (Anta) of the Vedas**, particularly the teachings found in the **Upanishads**.
- Deals with the nature of ultimate reality (_Brahman_), the self (_Atman_), and the relationship between the two.
- Based on three foundational sources, the **Upanishads**, the **Bhagavad Gita**, and the **Brahma Sutras**.

### Schools of Vedānta

Different schools of _Vedānta_ emerged based on the interpretations of *Brahma Sutras*:
- **Adi Shankaracharya's** _Advaita Vedānta_ (non-dualism) in 8th century CE, where _Brahman_ is considered the only reality, and the world is ultimately an illusion (_Maya_).
- **Ramanuja's** _Vishishtadvaita Vedānta_ (qualified non-dualism) in 11th century CE, where the world and individual souls are seen as real but dependent on _Brahman_.
- **Madhvacharya's** _Dvaita Vedānta_ (dualism) in 13th century CE, where God (_Brahman_), individual souls, and the world are all distinct realities.
