- Existence depends on knowledge
	- If there is no knower, there is no knowledge
	- If there is no awareness/consciousness, there is no knower
	- Knower, knowledge, and known
- The self has four aspects
	- Three states in maaya
		- Waker's world: Gross body
		- Dreamer's world: Subtle body
		- Deep Sleeper's world: Causal body
	- The three states are known to us
	- Upanishads enquire a fourth state, the consciousness 
- Using gold ornaments as an example:
	- Gold exists as a necklace, a braclet, and a tiara
	- When the necklace is melt into a braclet, the form has changed
	- If we take away the gold, none of the ornaments will exist
	- If gold is so valuable, why make it into ornaments. Well, how will you wear it?
