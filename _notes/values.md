title: Discovering my values
---
In ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), values are behaviors that represent how we want to live our lives and give us a sense of meaning and purpose. 

[Values are about "verbs and adverbs,"](https://every.to/no-small-plans/how-to-identify-and-live-your-life-by-your-values) focusing on what we would be doing if we were living meaningfully and how we want to show up in those actions. To get at a person’s values, you can ask: 
- What would you be doing if you were living meaningfully? (verb or actions) 
- How do you want to show up to whatever you’re doing? (adverb or intentions)
