## Highlights
- Intentional Love asks you to view your love life as a series of choices rather than accidents. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=135))
- I launched a side project called “Talks at Google: Modern Romance,” ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=162))
- our predecessors didn’t have to weigh where to live or what to do for a living, we make those choices now. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=232))
- The dark side of all this freedom and endless choice is the crippling fear that we’ll screw up our lifelong pursuit of happiness. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=235))
- We all want to build lasting and fulfilling partnerships, but it’s harder to do that when you lack relationship role models. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=277))
- How do healthy couples resolve conflict? How do happy spouses make decisions together? How do you successfully spend the rest of your life with one person?— ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=279))
- We can take control of our love lives by better understanding ourselves: what motivates us, what confuses us, what gets in our way. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=299))
- It will help identify what’s holding you back, so you can break your bad habits and develop new ones. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=327))

    - Note: 14
- people have either a soul mate mindset, the belief that relationship satisfaction comes from finding the right person; or a work-it-out mindset, the belief that relationship success derives from putting in effort. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=451))
- Romanticizers wait for love and won’t put effort in to create love. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=456))
- when the couple hits an inevitable obstacle—say, for instance, a particularly heated fight—they give up on the relationship rather than trying to overcome it. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=465))
- for most of history, the idea of marrying for love would have seemed silly. Marriage was about economics and convenience. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=475))
- That very narrow view of this person’s looks holds you back from seeing the possibilities in front of you. If you’re not perfect, why should this person be? ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=532))
- Finding someone can be hard, but often the real challenge comes later. The hard part is the daily work you put in to grow and sustain a great relationship. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=544))
- Love takes work—from finding it to keeping it alive. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=565))
- If you’re working hard at your relationship, that’s a good sign, not a bad one! ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=582))
- Many hours of a marriage are spent on the everyday, rarely posted minutiae of life: changing dirty diapers, doing laundry, and washing dishes. Love happens in these moments, not in spite of them. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=583))
- Remember, Satisficers can have very high standards. They may look around for a while until they find an option that meets their expectations. The difference is, once they find something that meets their standards, they are happy with it. They don’t wonder what else is out there. ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=713))
- You should interview 37 percent of the candidates and then pause. Identify the best person from this first group. Now you have a meaningful benchmark.

([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=724))
- The first opportunity cost is losing the chance to learn. You can’t figure out what you like (and what you don’t) if you don’t date different people. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=853))
- “I missed out on experimentation. I don’t know my likes and dislikes. And now it feels a lot harder to find a partner without that information.” ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=866))
- You need to practice asking interesting questions, expressing yourself in a compelling way, and going in for a first kiss. ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=882))
- Assemble a few solid date outfits. Consider going to an improv class to learn how to listen carefully and play well with others. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=905))
- How much are you focusing inward (How am I coming across?) versus really listening and being curious (What is this person trying to communicate?)? ([Location 906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=906))
- you may want to start seeing a therapist or coach. What’s been holding you back? What are your unspoken fears? What in your past is preventing you from moving forward? ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=912))
- While we instinctively prefer reversible decisions to irreversible ones, this flexibility often make us less happy in the long run. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1002))
- You can read entire books on the topic, including Attached, by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, and Hold Me Tight, by Sue Johnson, ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1076))
- Try to date secure partners. The ones who text when they say they will. Who let you know what’s on their mind. Who don’t play games and avoid or even de-escalate drama. ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1166))
- pay attention to your feelings when you sense yourself withdrawing. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1175))
- Learn to ask for space instead of disappearing into space. ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1176))
- when you sense yourself focusing on your partner’s shortcomings and wanting to leave because of them, try a different technique: Practice looking for the positive qualities instead. ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1176))
- we fall prey to the present bias, an error in judgment that causes us to place a disproportionately high value on the here and now and an inappropriately low value on the future. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1227))
- when you’re looking for a long-term partner, you want someone who will be there for you during the highs and the lows. Someone you can rely on. Someone to make decisions with. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1235))
- don’t ask yourself: What would a love story with this person look like? Instead, ask: Can I make a life with this person? ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1239))
- Money matters, but only up to a certain extent. You’re not wrong for considering that element of your future relationship, but don’t prioritize wealth above all else. ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1317))
- He found that over the course of seven years, “lust” (sexual desire) for a partner declined twice as fast as “liking” (friendship characterized by loyalty and kindness). ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1332))
- Pay attention to whether or not you’re attracted to someone and focus less on how society would evaluate that person’s looks. ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1353))
- We assume that the more similar we are, the easier the merger will be. But that assumption is wrong. ([Location 1363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1363))
- Find someone who complements you, not your personality twin. ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1377))
- It’s fine to have different interests, so long as the time you spend pursuing your favorite activities doesn’t preclude you from investing in the relationship. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1406))
- A good relationship has space for different people with different hobbies. ([Location 1410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1410))
- Don’t worry about finding someone with the same hobbies. It’s fine to enjoy different activities as long as you give each other the space and freedom to explore those hobbies on your own. ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1412))
- “Kind partners are awesome. They’re generous, they’re empathic, and they want to be supportive of you.” ([Location 1443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1443))
- Key tip for your dating search You can get a sense of how kind someone is by paying attention to how they treat people from whom they don’t need anything. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1445))
- One way to get a sense of someone’s emotional stability is to pay attention to how they respond to stressful situations. ([Location 1449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1449))
- “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” ([Location 1452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1452))
- How many old friendships have they carried with them over the years? ([Location 1470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1470))
- Do people from their past seem to rely on them for companionship and support? ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1471))
- A person with a growth mindset is much more likely to buckle down and work on improving things rather than give up on the relationship and assume things can’t be fixed. ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1480))
- You can spot people with a growth mindset by paying attention to how they handle themselves in different situations. ([Location 1483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1483))
- You must understand what qualities they bring out in you, because this is who you’ll be whenever you’re with them. ([Location 1502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1502))
- Instead of asking, “What did you think of him?” ask, “What did you think of me around him?” ([Location 1516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1516))
- The first step in fighting well is understanding that there are two types of problems in relationships: solvable problems and perpetual ones ([Location 1527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1527))
- 69 percent of all relationship conflicts are perpetual. ([Location 1528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1528))
- “When choosing a long-term partner, you will inevitably be choosing a particular set of unresolvable problems.” The goal isn’t to find someone with whom you don’t fight. It’s to choose a partner with whom you fight well, and who doesn’t make you worry that the fight will end the relationship. ([Location 1536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1536))
- Successful couples are able to break the intensity of a fight by making a joke, conceding a point, or telling their partner what they appreciate about them. ([Location 1540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1540))
- Pay attention to how you fight. Are you able to get your point across? Do you feel heard? Does your partner make repair attempts to de-escalate ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1543))
- What do you do if one of you gets an unbelievable job offer in another city? ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1546))
- How will you handle aging parents who need around-the-clock care? ([Location 1547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1547))
- The best way to know what it will be like to make decisions with someone is to actually make decisions together. ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1553))
- pay attention during shared experiences that challenge both of you. For example, what happens when you try to cook a complicated meal or travel internationally? ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1556))
- Is one of you comfortable leading and the other following, or do you both want to be in charge at all times? ([Location 1560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1560))
- the things that matter more usually reveal themselves only when you’re in a relationship or have gone on at least a few dates. ([Location 1565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1565))
- “I want him to make me feel smart, funny, appreciated, and secure in our relationship.” ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1585))
- our environment matters. We’re impacted by the setting in which we make our decision, whether that’s a physical location or a digital landscape. What we choose is highly affected by how the options are displayed. ([Location 1661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1661))
- Ariely found that a man has to earn $40,000 more each year to be as desirable as a man one inch taller. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1721))
- how much does a woman’s income affect her desirability? Turns out it doesn’t. ([Location 1727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1727))
- many consumer items are “searchable goods”: things like cameras, laundry detergent, and big-screen TVs that can be measured based on their objective attributes. These differ from “experience goods,” which they define as being “judged by the feelings they evoke, rather than the functions they perform. Examples include movies, perfume, puppies, and restaurant meals—goods defined by attributes that are subjective, aesthetic, holistic, emotive, and tied to the production of sensation. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1782))
- The Monet Effect helps explain why, when compared to internal candidates, external CEOs are often paid more but perform worse. ([Location 1831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1831))
- Looking at a dating app profile is the equivalent of seeing someone from very far away. All you get are a few carefully selected photos and some basic information. ([Location 1832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1832))
- Look for reasons to say yes. It’s tempting to approach dating apps as an exercise in discovering what’s wrong with people or finding a reason to say no. Instead, try to be less judgmental. ([Location 1869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1869))
- to propose a specific day and time for your date. “If you’re as charming in real life as you are over text, we may be onto something. Drinks Thursday? Seven p.m.?” ([Location 1988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=1988))
- From reviewing résumé qualities and asking, Is this person good enough for me? Do we have enough in common? to getting out of your own head and into the moment; to asking yourself, How do I feel with this person? ([Location 2280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2280))
- The point of the first date isn’t to decide if you want to marry someone or not. It’s to see if you’re curious about the person, if there’s something about them that makes you feel like you would enjoy spending more time together. ([Location 2310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2310))
- I’ve found “unlucky daters” behave similarly. They feel burned out after years of dating and bring that negative energy into every date. ([Location 2331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2331))
- being inquisitive tends to increase how much others like you. ([Location 2472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2472))
- “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” ([Location 2511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2511))
- the more we see something, the more we like it. Psychologists call this the mere exposure effect. ([Location 2612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2612))
- When we first meet people, we evaluate them on their mate value— their overall attractiveness and how they carry themselves. As we get to know and share experiences with them, we discover their unique value—who they are on the inside. ([Location 2629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2629))
- the fundamental-attribution error, our tendency to believe someone’s actions reflect who they are rather than the circumstances. ([Location 2723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2723))
- Look for what others might miss when they talk to the same person. As philosopher and writer Alain de Botton told me: Rather than focusing on someone’s negative traits, use your “imagination” to “search for what is desirable and good.” ([Location 2736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2736))
- he had to send me five nice things he noticed about her. Just like Alain de Botton said, he had to use his imagination and see beyond the surface. ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2745))
- Stop confusing pet peeves with dealbreakers. ([Location 2828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2828))
- Prioritize what actually matters long term. Do not let yourself get off track because of small distractions. ([Location 2837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2837))
- If your date is rude or disrespectful—to you or anyone else—don’t see that person again. Ditto if your date made you feel uncomfortable, anxious, or sad. ([Location 2887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2887))
- Do you want to see this person again? If so, let them know! ([Location 2894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2894))
- “Hey, that was fun. Can I see you again?” ([Location 2901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2901))
- People often ghost because they think they’re avoiding an awkward situation and protecting that person’s feelings. But that’s just not true. ([Location 2907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2907))
- “Hey [insert name]. I really enjoyed talking about [insert conversation topic]. I don’t think we’re a romantic match, but I enjoyed meeting you.” ([Location 2927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2927))
- “Thanks for letting me know. Good luck out there.” ([Location 2937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2937))
- Psychologists describe two ways couples transition into the next stage of a relationship: deciding or sliding. ([Location 2993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2993))
- individuals who tend to “slide” through relationship milestones feel less dedicated to their partners and engage in more extramarital affairs. ([Location 2999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=2999))
- DTR is an essential decision point. It’s a chance to discuss where you are and where you’re headed. ([Location 3020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=3020))
- Make sure to talk in person. Think through how you’ll open the conversation. One trick for tough talks is to start by announcing how awkward you feel. This alerts the person to the fact that you feel vulnerable, ([Location 3027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=3027))
- Try an opener like “I feel awkward bringing this up, but . . .” or “It’s always hard to ask this, but . . .” ([Location 3028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=3028))
- The way you handle the DTR will have an impact on your future relationship, ([Location 3044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SXX2QFM&location=3044))
