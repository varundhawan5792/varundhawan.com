## Highlights
- You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=280))
- the most powerful outcomes are delayed. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=326))
- The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=400))
- fall in love with the process rather than the product, ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=407))
- The problem is your system. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=418))
- Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=460))
- The problem is the direction of change. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=463))
- The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=472))
- Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=474))
- Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=501))
- your self-image gets in the way. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=536))
- continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=537))
- The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=569))
- Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader. ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=574))
- It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=582))
- What do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become? ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=585))
- The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=603))
- behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=648))
- Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=660))
- Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=670))
- people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=682))
- Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=705))
- Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=713))
- If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=724))
- One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=866))
- We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=867))
- There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=899))
- As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=905))
- implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.” ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=946))
- people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=956))
- Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=962))
- “no more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of his stuff. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=996))
- Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=997))
- You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing. ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1005))
- One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1009))
- a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1150))
- filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones. ([Location 1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1152))
- alter the spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1188))
- You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context. ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1202))
- Go to a new place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use—and create a new routine there. ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1209))
- Take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns. ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1216))
- When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1219))
- “One space, one use.” ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1220))
- avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1227))
- I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media ([Location 1234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1234))
- When the context changed, so did the habit. ([Location 1264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1264))
- Typically, 90 percent of heroin users become re-addicted once they return home from rehab. ([Location 1268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1268))
- the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. ([Location 1279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1279))
- Bad habits are autocatalytic: ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1290))
- Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. ([Location 1291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1291))
- It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits. ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1294))
- Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1300))
- simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1301))
- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1304))
- leave your phone in another room for a few hours. ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1306))
- If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy. ([Location 1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1307))
- Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible. ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1318))
- Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1370))
- Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1373))
- the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. ([Location 1374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1374))
- Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1383))
- Other processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, ([Location 1385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1385))
- They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1401))
- While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1408))
- The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped. ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1421))
- Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. ([Location 1428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1428))
- Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act. ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1435))
- Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them. The wanting centers in the brain are large: ([Location 1458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1458))
- allow Netflix to run only if he was cycling at a certain speed. ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1471))
- Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. ([Location 1475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1475))
- “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.” As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1551))
- We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the script handed down by our friends and family, ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1553))
- In many ways, these social norms are the invisible rules that guide your behavior each day. ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1556))
- We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:2 The close. The many. The powerful. ([Location 1563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1563))
- As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits. ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1574))
- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. ([Location 1584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1584))
- If you are surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider working out to be a common habit. ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1586))
- Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. ([Location 1590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1590))
- one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps. ([Location 1629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1629))
- Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. ([Location 1633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1633))
- We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves. Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we admire. ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1645))
- We imitate people we envy. ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1647))
- When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house because we don’t want to be judged. We are continually wondering “What will others think of me?” and altering our behavior based on the answer. ([Location 1650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1650))
- If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive. ([Location 1667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1667))
- Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature. ([Location 1709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1709))
- Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1719))
- Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive. ([Location 1766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1766))
- Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.” ([Location 1769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1769))
- You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.” ([Location 1778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1778))
- “My focus and concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on] while writing. I don’t even have to play any music.” ([Location 1786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1786))
- If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. ([Location 1858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1858))
- the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure. ([Location 1865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1865))
- Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing. ([Location 1869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1869))
- If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. ([Location 1871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1871))
- One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How many does it take to form a new habit?” ([Location 1915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1915))
- It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. ([Location 1963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1963))
- We are motivated to do what is easy. ([Location 1967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1967))
- the less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur. ([Location 1971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1971))
- In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. ([Location 1974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1974))
- You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. ([Location 1975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1975))
- If you can make your good habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them. ([Location 1978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1978))
- If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction of shopping for groceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making social introductions. ([Location 2012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2012))
- The purpose of resetting each room is not simply to clean up after the last action, but to prepare for the next action. ([Location 2036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2036))
- “How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?” Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do. ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2068))
- “The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body through each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I tell the driver where to go I have completed the ritual. ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2084))
- “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” You’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute version: ■ “Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.” ([Location 2121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2121))
- the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. ([Location 2139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2139))
- Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present. ([Location 2217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2217))
- resident James Ritty, it was the first cash register. The machine automatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each transaction. Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each. Employee theft at his store vanished overnight. ([Location 2228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2228))
- The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. ([Location 2234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2234))
- The brilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically impossible. ([Location 2235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2235))
- Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth. ([Location 2270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2270))
- “Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.” ([Location 2271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2271))
- We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” ([Location 2373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2373))
- the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. ([Location 2392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2392))
- the neocortex—the newest part of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language—was roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors. ([Location 2409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2409))
- our ancestors spent their days responding to grave threats, securing the next meal, and taking shelter from a storm. It made sense to place a high value on instant gratification. ([Location 2417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2417))
- Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their risk of obesity? ([Location 2424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2424))
- As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals. ([Location 2441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2441))
- In a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In the real world, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they have provided you with something. Early on, it’s all sacrifice. ([Location 2460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2460))
- Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish. Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing. ([Location 2469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2469))
- Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer $5. Pass on another month of Netflix? Move $10 over. ([Location 2475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2475))
- Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit. ([Location 2489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2489))
- Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one. Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of X’s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the calendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again. ([Location 2536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2536))
- The most effective form of motivation is progress.6 When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue ([Location 2547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2547))
- Tracking can become its own form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar. ([Location 2554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2554))
- First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. You’ll probably be surprised by how much you’re already tracking without knowing it. ([Location 2572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2572))
- Once you know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar to review it each week or each month, which is more practical than tracking it every day. ([Location 2575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2575))
- Second, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. ([Location 2576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2576))
- Finally, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs. ([Location 2578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2578))
- I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never miss twice. ([Location 2592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2592))
- Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. ([Location 2601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2601))
- Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. ([Location 2603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2603))
- The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind ([Location 2620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2620))
- This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. ([Location 2624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2624))
- Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” ([Location 2628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2628))
- Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can create a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. ([Location 2696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2696))
- There’s a strong genetic component to how obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how proactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how captivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences like attending a concert. ([Location 2831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2831))
- In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you. ([Location 2872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2872))
- the explore/exploit trade-off.17 In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. ([Location 2883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2883))
- The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore. ([Location 2887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2887))
- As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you: ([Location 2896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2896))
- Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you. ([Location 2928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2928))
- Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or soft. ([Location 2931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2931))
- The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. ([Location 2987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2987))
- really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. ([Location 3019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3019))
- Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those that provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide visual novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide culinary novelty. Each of these experiences offer continual elements of surprise. ([Location 3029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3029))
- Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom. ([Location 3036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3036))
- This is one of the benefits of following the Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit, working on challenges of just manageable difficulty is a good way to keep things interesting. ([Location 3040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3040))
- The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. ([Location 3078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3078))
- Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice. ([Location 3086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3086))
- Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. ([Location 3092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3092))
- Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about fine-tuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary ([Location 3157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3157))
- I employ two primary modes of reflection and review. ([Location 3160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3160))
- Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture. ([Location 3175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3175))
- Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. ([Location 3179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3179))
- reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most important aspects of behavior change: identity. ([Location 3181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3181))
- The more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied to our identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism. ([Location 3186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3186))
- In the words of investor Paul Graham, “keep your identity small.”10 The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. ([Location 3191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3191))
- The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes. ([Location 3201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3201))
- “I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and creates things.” ([Location 3207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3207))
- Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state. ([Location 3288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3288))
- Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it. ([Location 3291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3291))
- Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems. ([Location 3295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3295))
- If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, why you are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high. ([Location 3302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3302))
- “The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it.” ([Location 3306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3306))
- The feeling comes first, and then the behavior. ([Location 3310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3310))
- Our thoughts and actions are rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in what is logical. ([Location 3316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3316))
- Suffering drives progress. ([Location 3323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3323))
- The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action. ([Location 3324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3324))
- Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying. ([Location 3330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3330))
- Our expectations determine our satisfaction. The gap between our cravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel after taking action. ([Location 3333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3333))
