## Highlights
- it’s hard to think about life in general, but once you apply the metaphor “life is a journey,” the metaphor guides you to some conclusions: You should learn the terrain, pick a direction, find some good traveling companions, and enjoy the trip, because there may be nothing at the end of the road. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=127))
- To understand most important ideas in psychology, you need to understand how the mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=173))
- The gut brain makes its independence known in many ways: ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=193))
- The independence of the gut brain, combined with the autonomic nature of changes to the genitals, probably contributed to ancient Indian theories in which the abdomen contains the three lower chakras—energy centers corresponding to the colon/anus, sexual organs, and gut. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=199))
- This finding, that people will readily fabricate reasons to explain their own behavior, is called “confabulation.” ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=242))
- the language centers on the left side of the brain as the interpreter module, whose job is to give a running commentary on whatever the self is doing, even though the interpreter module has no access to the real causes or motives of the self’s behavior. ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=244))
- Gazzaniga’s “interpreter module” is, essentially, the rider. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=258))
- The brain started off with just three rooms, or clumps of neurons: a hindbrain (connected to the spinal column), a midbrain, and a forebrain (connected to the sensory organs at the front of the animal). ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=264))
- The forebrain of the earliest mammals developed a new outer shell, which included the hypothalamus (specialized to coordinate basic drives and motivations), the hippocampus (specialized for memory), and the amygdala (specialized for emotional learning and responding). ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=267))
- Instead, it is available to make new associations and to engage in thinking, planning, and decision making—mental processes that can free an organism from ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=274))
- the frontal cortex plays an important role in suppressing or inhibiting behavioral impulses. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=287))
- The orbitofrontal cortex plays a central role when you size up the reward and punishment possibilities of a situation; the neurons in this part of the cortex fire wildly when there is an immediate possibility of pleasure or pain, loss or gain. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=300))
- Human rationality depends critically on sophisticated emotionality. It is only because our emotional brains works so well that our reasoning can work at all. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=319))
- The metaphor of a rider on an elephant fits Damasio’s findings more closely: Reason and emotion must both work together to create intelligent behavior, but emotion (a major part of the elephant) does most of the work. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=321))
- They are like new software, Rider version 1.0. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=367))
- Automatic processes, on the other hand, have been through thousands of product cycles and are nearly perfect. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=369))
- When language evolved, the human brain was not reengineered to hand over the reins of power to the rider ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=374))
- it helped the elephant do something important in a better way. The rider evolved to serve to the elephant. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=376))
- In sum, the rider is an advisor or servant; not a king, president, or charioteer with a firm grip on the reins. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=399))
- An emotionally intelligent person has a skilled rider who knows how to distract and coax the elephant without having to engage in a direct contest of wills. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=422))
- Automatic processes generate thousands of thoughts and images every day, often through random association. The ones that get stuck are the ones that particularly shock us, the ones we try to suppress or deny. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=457))
- The reason we suppress them is not that we know, deep down, that they’re true (although some may be), but that they are scary or shameful. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=459))
- You don’t really know why you think something is beautiful, but your interpreter module (the rider) is skilled at making up reasons, ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=475))
- Moral arguments are much the same: Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first, and their reasons are invented on the fly, to throw at each other. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=478))
- the argument you defeated was not the cause of her position; it was made up after the judgment was already made. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=480))
- Events in the world affect us only through our interpretations of them, so if we can control our interpretations, we can control our world. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=504))
- “There is no reality, only perception.” ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=508))
- “Nothing is miserable unless you think it so; and on the other hand, nothing brings happiness unless you are content with it.” ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=543))
- nothing brings happiness unless you are content with it.” ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=543))
- freedom through insight ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=546))
- Epiphanies can be life-altering,8 but most fade in days or weeks. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=550))
- Lasting change can come only by retraining the elephant, and that’s hard to do. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=552))
- The most important words in the elephant’s language are “like” and “dislike,” or “approach” and “withdraw.” ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=557))
- careful experiments show that you have a like-dislike reaction to everything you are experiencing, even if you’re not aware of the experience. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=564))
- The unsettling implication of Pelham’s work is that the three biggest decisions most of us make—what to do with our lives, where to live, and whom to marry—can all be influenced (even if only slightly) by something as trivial as the sound of a name. ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=592))
- Responses to threats and unpleasantness are faster, stronger, and harder to inhibit than responses to opportunities and pleasures. ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=607))
- Over and over again, psychologists find that the human mind reacts to bad things more quickly, strongly, and persistently than to equivalent good things. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=614))
- Opposing systems push against each other to reach a balance point, but the balance point is adjustable. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=618))
- All neural impulses from the eyes and ears go first to the thalamus, a kind of central switching station in the brain. From the thalamus, neural impulses are sent out to special sensory processing areas in the cortex; and from those areas, information is relayed to the frontal cortex, where it is integrated with other higher mental processes and your ongoing stream of consciousness. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=631))
- It’s easy to see why a neural shortcut would be advantageous, and the amygdala is that shortcut. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=635))
- it responds to patterns that in the past were associated with danger. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=637))
- Not only does it reach down to the brainstem to trigger a response to danger but it reaches up to the frontal cortex to change your thinking. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=647))
- Thoughts can cause emotions (as when you reflect on a foolish thing you said), but emotions can also cause thoughts, ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=649))
- And the only way to step away, to make yourself not react to the ups and downs of life, is to meditate and tame the mind. Although you give up the pleasures of winning, you also give up the larger pains of losing. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=745))
- The discovery is that meditation tames and calms the elephant. Meditation done every day for several months can help you reduce substantially the frequency of fearful, negative, and grasping thoughts, thereby improving your affective style. ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=748))
- (The elephant learns best from daily practice; ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=782))
- Most interactions among animals (other than close kin) are zero-sum games: One animal’s gain is the other’s loss. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=971))
- ancestors locate fruit. But the only theory that explains ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1030))
- In other words, all over the animal kingdom, brains grow to manage larger and larger groups. Social animals are smart animals. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1034))
- and this urge itself illustrates Dunbar’s point: We are motivated to pass on information to our friends; we even sometimes say, “I can’t keep it in, I have to tell somebody.” ([Location 1050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1050))
- In financial bargaining, too, people who stake out an extreme first position and then move toward the middle end up doing better than those who state a more reasonable first position and then hold fast. ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1105))
- When someone tells you about past romantic relationships, there is conversational pressure for you to do the same. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1118))
- But it’s not just that we mimic those we like; we like those who mimic us. ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1125))
- Reciprocity, like love, reconnects us with others. ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1131))
- Scandal is great entertainment because it allows people to feel contempt, a moral emotion that gives feelings of moral superiority while asking nothing in return. ([Location 1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1152))
- One of the most universal pieces of advice from across cultures and eras is that we are all hypocrites, ([Location 1157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1157))
- people who think they are particularly moral are in fact more likely to “do the right thing” and flip the coin, but when the coin flip comes out against them, they find a way to ignore it and follow their own self-interest. ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1192))
- When people were forced to think about fairness and could see themselves cheating, they stopped doing it. ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1199))
- it is easy to spot a cheater when our eyes are looking outward, but hard when looking inward. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1200))
- we are fairly accurate in our perceptions of others. It’s our self-perceptions that are distorted because we look at ourselves in a rose-colored mirror. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1272))
- We judge others by their behavior, but we think we have special information about ourselves— we know what we are “really like” inside, so we can easily find ways to explain away our selfish acts and cling to the illusion that we are better than others. ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1293))
- In fact, evidence shows that people who hold pervasive positive illusions about themselves, their abilities, and their future prospects are mentally healthier, happier, and better liked than people who lack such illusions. ([Location 1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1307))
- people really are open to information that will predict the behavior of others, but they refuse to adjust their self-assessments. ([Location 1341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1341))
- The two biggest causes of evil are two that we think are good, and that we try to encourage in our children: high self-esteem and moral idealism. ([Location 1437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1437))
- Having high self-esteem doesn’t directly cause violence, but when someone’s high esteem is unrealistic or narcissistic, it is easily threatened by reality; in reaction to those threats, people—particularly young men—often lash out violently. ([Location 1438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1438))
- That is, the world we live in is not really one made of rocks, trees, and physical objects; it is a world of insults, opportunities, status symbols, betrayals, saints, and sinners. ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1457))
- Violations of these should statements are the major causes of anger and resentment. ([Location 1494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1494))
- When you find a fault in yourself it will hurt, briefly, but if you keep going and acknowledge the fault, you are likely to be rewarded with a flash of pleasure that is mixed, oddly, with a hint of pride. ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1504))
- Finding fault with yourself is also the key to overcoming the hypocrisy and judgmentalism that damage so many valuable relationships. ([Location 1506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1506))
- Happiness can only be found within, by breaking attachments to external things and cultivating an attitude of acceptance. ([Location 1541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1541))
- The elephant learns whenever pleasure (or pain) follows immediately after behavior, but it has trouble connecting success on Friday with actions it took on Monday. ([Location 1563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1563))
- We can call this “the progress principle”: Pleasure comes more from making progress toward goals than from achieving them. ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1574))
- We are bad at “affective forecasting,”5 that is, predicting how we’ll feel in the future. We grossly overestimate the intensity and the duration of our emotional reactions. ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1585))
- The winner’s pleasure comes from rising in wealth, not from standing still at a high level, ([Location 1590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1590))
- A good marriage is one of the life-factors most strongly and consistently associated with happiness. ([Location 1643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1643))
- religious people are happier, on average, than nonreligious people. ([Location 1649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1649))
- Voluntary activities, on the other hand, are the things that you choose to do, such as meditation, exercise, learning a new skill, or taking a vacation. ([Location 1711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1711))
- Voluntary activities, therefore, offer much greater promise for increasing happiness while avoiding adaptation effects. ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1713))
- The level of happiness that you actually experience (H) is determined by your biological set point (S) plus the conditions of your life (C) plus the voluntary activities (V) you do. ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1716))
- Noise, especially noise that is variable or intermittent, interferes with concentration and increases stress.35 It’s worth striving to remove sources of noise in your life. ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1732))
- Even after years of commuting, those whose commutes are traffic-filled still arrive at work with higher levels of stress hormones. ([Location 1737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1737))
- that Rodin and I wrote, we concluded that changing an institution’s environment to increase the sense of control among its workers, students, patients, or other users was one of the most effective possible ways to increase their sense of engagement, energy, and happiness.41 ([Location 1753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1753))
- consciousness. Gratifications can lead to flow. Seligman proposes that V (voluntary activities) is largely a matter of arranging your day and your environment to increase both pleasures and gratifications. ([Location 1805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1805))
- Pleasures should be both savored and varied. ([Location 1810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1810))
- Variety is the spice of life because it is the natural enemy of adaptation. ([Location 1814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1814))
- Gratifications often come from accomplishing something, learning something, or improving something. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1820))
- You can find out your strengths by taking an online test at www.authentichappiness.org ([Location 1824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1824))
- The other three activities were potential gratifications: Attend a lecture or class that you don’t normally go to; perform an act of kindness for a friend who could use some cheering up; and write down the reasons you are grateful to someone and later call or visit that person to express your gratitude. ([Location 1828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1828))
- if you know your strengths and draw up a list of five activities that engage them, you can surely add at least one gratification to every day. ([Location 1838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1838))
- Evolution seems to have made us “strategically irrational” at times for our own good; ([Location 1849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1849))
- Frank concludes that those who think money can’t buy happiness just don’t know where to shop. ([Location 1855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1855))
- people would be happier and healthier if they took more time off and “spent” it with their family and friends, ([Location 1858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1858))
- People would be happier if they reduced their commuting time, even if it meant living in smaller houses, ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1859))
- People would be happier and healthier if they took longer vacations, even if that meant earning less, ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1860))
- Conspicuous consumption refers to things that are visible to others and that are taken as markers of a person’s relative success. ([Location 1865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1865))
- Inconspicuous consumption, on the other hand, refers to goods and activities that are valued for themselves, that are usually consumed more privately, and that are not bought for the purpose of achieving status. ([Location 1870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1870))
- Those who described buying an experience (such as a ski trip, a concert, or a great meal) were happier when thinking about their purchase, and thought that their money was better spent, ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1883))
- Activities connect us to others; objects often separate us. ([Location 1888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1888))
- The elephant cares about prestige, not happiness ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1898))
- The more choices there are, the more you expect to find a perfect fit; yet, at the same time, the larger the array, the less likely it becomes that you picked the best item. ([Location 1909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1909))
- Yes, attachments bring pain, but they also bring our greatest joys, and there is value in the very variation that the philosophers are trying to avoid. ([Location 1973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1973))
- Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without. ([Location 1988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=1988))
- A child who stays safe survives; a child who explores and plays develops the skills and intelligence needed for adult life. ([Location 2113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2113))
- If you want your children to grow up to be healthy and independent, you should hold them, hug them, cuddle them, and love them. ([Location 2134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2134))
- If you are in passionate love and want to celebrate your passion, read poetry. If your ardor has calmed and you want to understand your evolving relationship, read psychology. ([Location 2375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2375))
- Without having formed an attachment relationship, they would likely be fearful of new experiences and unable to love or care for other monkeys. ([Location 2437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2437))
- It’s not just that extroverts are naturally happier and healthier; when introverts are forced to be more outgoing, they usually enjoy it and find that it boosts their mood. ([Location 2477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2477))
- Psychologists often approach personality by measuring basic traits such as the “big five”: neuroticism, extroversion, openness to new experiences, agreeableness (warmth/niceness), and conscientiousness.15 These traits are facts about the elephant, about a person’s automatic reactions to various situations. ([Location 2620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2620))
- people develop to succeed in their particular roles and niches. These adaptations are influenced by basic traits: ([Location 2628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2628))
- Most of the life goals that people pursue at the level of “characteristic adaptations” can be sorted—as the psychologist Robert Emmons19 has found—into four categories: work and achievement, relationships and intimacy, religion and spirituality, and generativity (leaving a legacy and contributing something to society). ([Location 2641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2641))
- Because human beings were shaped by evolutionary processes to pursue success, not happiness, people enthusiastically pursue goals that will help them win prestige in zero-sum competitions. ([Location 2647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2647))
- people who are mentally healthy and happy have a higher degree of “vertical coherence” among their goals—that is, higher-level (long term) goals and lower-level (immediate) goals all fit together well so that pursuing one’s short-term goals advances the pursuit of long-term goals. ([Location 2677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2677))
- This coherence might not be visible to one’s friends, but it feels like growth, strength, maturity, and wisdom from the inside. ([Location 2684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2684))

- Once Pennebaker had found a correlation between disclosure and health, he took the next step in the scientific process and tried to create health benefits by getting people to disclose their secrets. ([Location 2721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2721))
- It was the people who made progress across the four days, who showed increasing insight; they were the ones whose health improved over the next year. ([Location 2734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2734))
- You have to use words, and the words have to help you create a meaningful story. ([Location 2737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2737))
- The first step is to do what you can, before adversity strikes, to change your cognitive style. If you are a pessimist, consider meditation, cognitive therapy, or even Prozac. ([Location 2741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2741))
- The second step is to cherish and build your social support network. Having one or two good attachment relationships helps adults as well as children (and rhesus monkeys) to face threats. ([Location 2743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2743))
- no matter how well or poorly prepared you are when trouble strikes, at some point in the months afterwards, pull out a piece of paper and start writing. ([Location 2749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2749))

- Before you conclude your last session, be sure you have done your best to answer these two questions: Why did this happen? What good might I derive from it? ([Location 2754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2754))
- Good parenting can help tune up the attachment system to make a child more adventurous; yet, even beyond such effects, if a child’s environment feels safe and controllable, the child will (on average) develop a more positive affective style, and will be less anxious as an adult. ([Location 2762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2762))
- Of course, children need limits to learn self-control, and they need plenty of failure to learn that success takes hard work and persistence. Children should be protected, but not spoiled. ([Location 2771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2771))

- We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. ([Location 2811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2811))
- First, wise people are able to balance their own needs, the needs of others, and the needs of people or things beyond the immediate interaction ([Location 2821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2821))
- Second, wise people are able to balance three responses to situations: adaptation (changing the self to fit the environment), shaping (changing the environment), and selection (choosing to move to a new environment). ([Location 2825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2825))
- “serenity prayer”: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.” ([Location 2827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2827))
- The best they can do is provide a range of life experiences that will help their children acquire tacit knowledge in a variety of life domains. ([Location 2831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2831))
- Suffering often makes people more compassionate, helping them find balance between self and others. ([Location 2834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2834))

- Cultivating the appearance of virtue will make you successful, and therefore happy, regardless of your true character. ([Location 2902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2902))
- Kant turned the problem around and said that people should think about whether the rules guiding their own actions could reasonably be proposed as universal laws. If you are planning to break a promise that has become inconvenient, can you really propose a universal rule that states people ought to break promises that have become inconvenient? ([Location 2972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2972))
- You don’t need a rich, thick description of the people involved, or of their beliefs and cultural traditions. You just need a few facts and a ranked list of their likes and dislikes ([Location 2993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=2993))
- six broad virtues, or families of related virtues, appeared on nearly all lists: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence (the ability to forge connections to something larger than the self). ([Location 3075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3075))

- as children develop an increasingly sophisticated understanding of right and wrong, they go through a phase in which many rules take on a kind of sacredness and unchangeability. ([Location 3137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3137))
- Moral motivations (justice, honor, loyalty, patriotism) enter into most acts of violence, including terrorism and war. Most people believe their actions are morally justified. ([Location 3150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3150))
- Brown’s finding shows directly that, at least for older people, it really is more blessed to give than to receive. ([Location 3194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3194))
- In old age, when social networks are thinned by the deaths of friends and family, the social benefits of volunteering are strongest ([Location 3199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3199))
- Before the Industrial Revolution, Americans honored the virtues of “producers”—hard work, self-restraint, sacrifice for the future, and sacrifice for the common good. ([Location 3223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3223))
- Asking children to grow virtues hydroponically, looking only within themselves for guidance, is like asking each one to invent a personal language—a pointless and isolating task if there is no community with whom to speak. ([Location 3234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3234))
- there are two main kinds of diversity—demographic and moral. ([Location 3251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3251))

- In all human cultures, the social world has two clear dimensions: a horizontal dimension of closeness or liking, and a vertical one of hierarchy or status. ([Location 3316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3316))
- Disgust extinguishes desire (hunger) and motivates purifying behaviors such as washing or, if it’s too late, vomiting. ([Location 3369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3369))
- The overwhelming evidence is that we are animals, and so a culture that rejects our animality must go to great lengths to hide the evidence. ([Location 3385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3385))
- when people think about morality, their moral concepts cluster into three groups, which he calls the ethic of autonomy, the ethic of community, and the ethic of divinity. ([Location 3406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3406))
- I found that educated Americans of high social class relied overwhelmingly on the ethic of autonomy in their moral discourse, whereas Brazilians, and people of lower social class in both countries, made much greater use of the ethics of community and divinity. ([Location 3413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3413))
- People really do respond emotionally to acts of moral beauty, and these emotional reactions involve warm or pleasant feelings in the chest and conscious desires to help others or become a better person oneself. ([Location 3556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3556))
- Something about the vastness and beauty of nature makes the self feel small and insignificant, and anything that shrinks the self creates an opportunity for spiritual experience. ([Location 3635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3635))
- There are many other ways of getting such a foretaste. People often refer to viewing great art, hearing a symphony, or listening to an inspiring speaker as (crypto) religious experiences. ([Location 3640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3640))
- the emotion of awe happens when two conditions are met: a person perceives something vast (usually physically vast, but sometimes conceptually vast, such as a grand theory; or socially vast, such as great fame or power); and the vast thing cannot be accommodated by the person’s existing mental structures. ([Location 3676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3676))

- I believe it is dangerous for the ethic of divinity to supersede the ethic of autonomy in the governance of a diverse modern democracy. However, I also believe that life in a society that entirely ignored the ethic of divinity would be ugly and unsatisfying. ([Location 3825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3825))

- Men who were closely supervised in jobs of low complexity and much routine showed the highest degree of alienation (feeling powerless, dissatisfied, and separated from the work). Men who had more latitude in deciding how they approached work that was varied and challenging tended to enjoy their work much more. ([Location 3992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=3992))

- If your lower-level traits match up with your coping mechanisms, which in turn are consistent with your life story, your personality is well integrated and you can get on with the business of living. ([Location 4094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00YY05O7G&location=4094))
