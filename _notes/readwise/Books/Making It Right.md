## Highlights
- How easy is the product to use? How feature rich is it? How fast is it? How extensible is it? How polished is it? How many (or rather, how few) bugs does it have? ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=181))
- The only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=185))
- The team created a collaborative work space7 based on the following principles: ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=299))
    - Note: Ideas for creating a collaborative workspace
- The team uses this specifically for design critiques, but it can be applied generically to any kind of feedback session. Here’s how the process works: ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=347))
    - Note: Process for design critique sessions
- Use a validation stack to defend decisions ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=434))
    - Note: To research
- the strategic product plan: a document that summarizes what the product is about, who it’s for, and the plan to make it a success. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=669))
- Quantitative research allows you to understand what is happening, or how much of it is happening. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=698))
- Qualitative research helps you understand how or why certain behaviors occur. ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=699))
- Market research seeks to understand the needs of a market in general. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=701))
- User research, on the other hand, focuses on users’ interactions with a product. It is concerned with how people interact with technology, and what we can learn from their wants, needs, and frustrations. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=705))
- Editorially ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=744))
- Everpix ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=747))
- Iron Maiden ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=804))
- What’s the use of fast iteration if all it does is get us to a suboptimal solution more quickly, when there might be a much better solution out there? ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=981))
- Once something has shipped, you can either iterate or pivot. Iteration is great if you’re on the right path. Pivoting is dangerous because changing course can wreak havoc on employees and users alike. ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=994))
- product discovery: a process that helps us understand the problem properly so we don’t just design things better, but design better things. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=997))
- For existing products, what are the shortcomings we need to fix? ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=1008))
- Fishbone diagrams and the five whys are two root-cause analysis techniques that can be applied very effectively to defining a problem ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=1016))
- create a customer journey ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=1077))
    - Note: Figure out how to work on personas and journey maps
- Variation is a way to explore a bunch of alternative product solutions. In contrast, iteration solidifies the product idea that gets chosen. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=1118))
- In my view, product roadmaps should contain the following elements: •The priority of the project (1 being the highest priority, all the way down). •A summary of no more than ten words. •A detailed description of no more than fifty words. •A list of contacts involved in the project (PM, business, development lead). •An indication of the business impact and the estimated level of effort. •A link to the functional specification as soon as it’s available. You’ll notice there’s something conspicuously missing from this list: dates. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=1445))
    - Note: What goes on a product roadmap
- A problem definition is a short statement of the problem you’re trying to solve. A specification explains how to solve the problem. ([Location 1510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=1510))
- An effective problem definition includes the following elements: •It clearly defines target users (the target users can also be the business or the development team). •It clearly defines the problem that needs to be solved. •It clearly defines under what circumstances the problem occurs (the trigger events). •It has enough supporting documentation to provide context on the target users and the problem to guide the design of the solution. ([Location 1519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=1519))
    - Note: Problem Definition
- specs aren’t bad — bad specs are bad. ([Location 2007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M0KTVTO&location=2007))
