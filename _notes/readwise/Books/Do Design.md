## Highlights
- I have always been fascinated by beautiful things: architecture, furniture, books. Beautiful things are prepared with love. The act of creating something of beauty is a way of bringing good into the world. Infused with optimism, it says simply: Life is worthwhile.

- Do not make that which is not useful. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F11ZLJW&location=143))
