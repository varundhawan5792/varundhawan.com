## Highlights
- Three out of every four Business to Business (B2B) buyers would rather self-educate than learn about a product from a sales representative, ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=222))
- “Enterprise buyers also expect to try and evaluate software in an easy, frictionless way.” ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=230))
- go-to-market (GTM) strategy10 is an action plan that specifies how a company will reach target customers and achieve a competitive advantage. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=245))
- If the only way you can sell a product is if someone talks to you, you’re using a sales-led strategy. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=253))
- if you’re tackling enterprise first and have a highly complex solution, you may need a high-touch sales model because of the complexities of their procurement process and implementation. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=267))
- When you’re launching a new category, you have to change the way people approach problems. This not only takes time but requires you to educate people on how to do things differently. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=273))
- the CAC is out of control, and the sales cycles are extremely long. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=282))
- Does downloading a whitepaper mean you’re ready to buy? Absolutely not. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=300))
- The problem with this organizational structure is that the product is often an afterthought. If the sales team closes a really big customer on the condition of a few product tweaks, well, the engineering and product team have a new project to do. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=306))
- My biggest regret is that our first customer was $1M ACV. Ever since that first customer, our product, go-to-market, our support model have all been pulled in one direction — high-end enterprise. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=314))
- What makes product-led organizations unique is that they lead with the product across every department, ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=333))
- What makes a product-led business unique is that all teams leverage the product to hit their goals. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=337))
- Your entire approach as an organization needs to shift. Instead of leading with sales and following with product, you need to make sure that every team has a hand in helping each user become successful. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=350))
- Market Strategy: Is your growth strategy dominant, disruptive, or differentiated? ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=410))
- Differentiated SaaS Growth Strategy This is a common strategy if you want to pick (and win) your fight with an industry goliath. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=439))
- Differentiated growth requires you to do a specific job better than the competition and charge significantly more. This is not a one-size-fits-all model. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=444))
- Your competitive advantage is how you solve your customer’s problems. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=449))
- Do you want to offer the best-customized solution for the highest price to underserved customers? (Differentiated strategy) ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=483))
- When using a top-down selling strategy, your sales team targets key decision-makers and executives. Typically, these deals include large product rollouts throughout an entire business. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=559))
- With a top-down selling strategy, you’ll typically make the sale to the decision-makers at the top of the organization. But the real selling has just begun. Now, you have to convince internal teams to use your software. ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=567))
- When I was working at a B2B SaaS startup, we employed a top-down selling strategy and a free trial. But after people signed up, there was no onboarding, no helpful emails, and no support. The experience was bad. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=669))
- If a company employs a top-down selling strategy, they have the systems and expertise in place to convert demo requests into customers. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=673))
- I challenge you to identify the top two user types who sign up for your product. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=707))
    - Note: Rookies and Veterans
- Want to strengthen user motivation? Hire a great copywriter. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=711))
- UCD framework, which shows you how to build a solid foundation for your product-led business. ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=772))
- If you skip one step, you risk delivering a mediocre experience to your users. So, please don’t skip any. ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=785))
- What outcome do people expect when they buy your product? ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=799))
- Most technology companies get caught up in the features and don’t really know why people buy their product. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=800))
- One of the biggest differences between sales- and product-led companies is that the latter consistently monitor these usage patterns to see if users are accomplishing meaningful outcomes. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=833))
- there are two types of value metrics: functional and outcome based. Functional value metrics are “per user” or “per 100 videos.” Pricing scales around a function of usage. Outcome-based value metrics charge based on an outcome, like how many views a video received or how much money you made your customer. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=850))
- make sure that your value metric aligns with the value that customers receive by using the product. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=873))
- what core components lead someone to experience a meaningful outcome? ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=882))
- Given that Slack’s value metric is the number of users you add to the messaging platform, it makes sense to charge per user. ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=890))
- Slack created the fair billing policy—you get charged only for active users. ([Location 893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=893))
- it’s easy to optimize for everyone while creating a worse experience for your best users. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=941))
- To get meaningful insights out of your product data, look for patterns among your best and worst customers. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=945))
- in a product-led business, your revenue and customer acquisition model are married together. ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=979))
- Don’t create a free plan with no incentive to upgrade. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=996))
- Not only did the B2B brands drive more emotional connections than B2C brands, but they weren’t even close. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=1120))
- We all invest our money in products, experiences, and services that make us feel a certain way – loved, safe, appreciated, part of a community, strong or perhaps just better than others. ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P6288ZF&location=1125))
