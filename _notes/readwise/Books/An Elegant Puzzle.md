## Highlights
- for a team that started out falling behind and is now repaying debt, your stakeholders are probably antsy waiting for the team to start delivering new stuff, and your obligation is to prevent that impatience from causing a backslide!

- maintain enough slack in your team’s schedule that the team can build quality into their work, ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=312))
- ensure that the work your team is doing is valued: ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=313))
- I’ve found it much easier to have rapid growth periods for any given team, followed by consolidation/gelling periods during which the team gels. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=330))
- Teams take a long time to gel. When a group has been working together for a few years, they understand each other and know how to set each other up for success in a truly remarkable way. Shifting individuals across teams can reset the clock on gelling, ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=347))
- moving one person can shift an innovating team back into falling behind, and now neither team is doing particularly well. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=356))
- An old-timer summarized their experience as: “We’re growing so quickly that every six months we’re a new company.” ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=398))
- I believe that the balancing of positive and negative freedoms is a fundamental task of managers and management. ([Location 2207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=2207))
- we can carefully ramp toward negative freedom and away from positive freedom. This is one of our essential tools for facilitating and prolonging success. ([Location 2209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=2209))
- generally follow the standard operating procedure (i.e., keep doing what you’re already doing, the way you’re doing it), but always change exactly one thing for each new project. ([Location 2220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=2220))
- Anywhere you find managerial desperation and a hardworking team, “Do It Harder” may be visiting. ([Location 2239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=2239))
- A couple are quietly bitter because of your newly elevated status, but most just don’t know how to contribute anymore, because you and your hero peers are rewriting the existing system, debugging the outages, and cherry-picking the easy wins. What’s left for them to do? ([Location 2250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=2250))
- your options are limited: either kill the environment that breeds hero programmers, or kill the hero programmer by burnout. ([Location 2255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=2255))
