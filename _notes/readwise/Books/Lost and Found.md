- Principal #6: enhanced access ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01830DBSQ&location=477))
- The most notable include an increased number of aging adults with chronic diseases, an explosion of growth in the pharmaceutical industry, a rise in malpractice concerns, an expanded regulatory environment, a growing pool of recently insured patients, and the integration of the EHR. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01830DBSQ&location=645))
- In the primary care exam room, it begins with a specially trained medical assistant or nurse who opens your visit by asking you symptom or disease-associated questions (based on physician-developed protocols) for your current episode of care. He or she enters your information into the EHR and updates your records as needed. When your doctor enters the room, the clinical assistant verbally presents your data for verification (on the part of the patient) and completion. The assistant documents the rest of the visit, reinforces the treatment plan, and provides follow-up information. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01830DBSQ&location=654))

- within a decade or so, a high percentage of the American workers who now receive health insurance through their employers will transition into the government-administered health exchanges that have been created by the Affordable Care Act. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01830DBSQ&location=787))
- “Covered by insurance” really means insurance will cover much of the cost after high deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01830DBSQ&location=799))
- The higher the monthly payments, the lower the out-of-pocket costs for services received during the year. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01830DBSQ&location=843))
- no person may be denied health insurance no matter how many pre-existing health issues he or she has. ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01830DBSQ&location=862))
- Additionally, there are no price increases for insurance coverage due to pre-existing conditions. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01830DBSQ&location=864))
- You can obtain your insurance through your employer, the Health Insurance Marketplace, private insurance companies, Medicaid and Medicare ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01830DBSQ&location=871))
- If you have an employer-sponsored health plan, this is almost always the best place for you to choose your insurance. ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01830DBSQ&location=896))
- Higher deductibles represent one way to ensure employees understand the cost impact of their healthcare decisions. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01830DBSQ&location=900))
