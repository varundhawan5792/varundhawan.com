## Highlights
- The answers were hard to pull out, even though they were just beneath the surface. Fear: of being ridiculed; of failing; of not looking like the smartest person in the room. And arrogance: I am too important for these games. “What a stupid question,” we had grown used to hearing. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XX4KH4R&location=119))
- We shared our personal passions and philosophies. We were asked to reflect on who we are, both in our home lives and at work. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XX4KH4R&location=123))
- we spend far too much time at work for it not to have deep meaning. If we can connect what we stand for as individuals with what this company is capable of, there is very little we can’t accomplish. ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XX4KH4R&location=133))

- what kind of CEO asks such existential questions as why do we exist in the first place? Why are concepts like culture, ideas, and empathy so important to me? ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XX4KH4R&location=247))
