## Highlights
- Be supple mentally. Strength does not lie in being firm and strong but in being pliable. ([Location 53](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0852PZQVJ&location=53))
- To see and be aware of one’s thoughts makes one intensively sensitive, pliable and alert. ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0852PZQVJ&location=76))
- generally one is so eager to get what one wants that one dashes against it. Either one breaks oneself on the obstacle or one exhausts oneself in the struggle against it. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0852PZQVJ&location=81))
- It is the quality of freshness, of newness, that is essential, or otherwise life becomes a routine, a habit; ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0852PZQVJ&location=101))
- One is everlastingly comparing oneself with another, with what one is, with what one should be, with someone more fortunate. This comparison kills. Comparison is degrading; it perverts one’s outlook. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0852PZQVJ&location=142))
- To bring up children without comparison is true education. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0852PZQVJ&location=146))
- To learn to be quiet, shutting oneself in one’s room to give the mind a rest, becomes a necessity. Love is part of this aloneness. To be simple, clear and inwardly quiet is to have that flame. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0852PZQVJ&location=155))
