## Highlights
- Listening has importance only when one is not projecting one’s own desires through which one listens. Can one put aside all these screens through which we listen, and really listen? ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=160))
- To listen there must be an inward quietness, a freedom from the strain of acquiring, a relaxed attention. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=166))
- Most of us are after results, achieving goals; we are forever overcoming and conquering, and so there is no listening. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=169))
- Be simple … and don’t try to become something ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=189))
- Most people think that learning is encouraged through comparison, whereas the contrary is the fact. Comparison brings about frustration and merely encourages envy, which is called competition. Like other forms of persuasion, comparison prevents learning and breeds fear. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=254))
- You know, to destroy is to create. We must destroy, not the buildings, not the social or economic system—this comes about daily—but the psychological, the unconscious and the conscious defenses, securities that one has built up rationally, individually, deeply, and superficially. We must tear through all that to be utterly defenseless, because you must be defenseless to love and have affection. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=297))
- To understand all authority—of the gurus, of the Masters, and others—requires a very sharp mind, a clear brain, not a muddy brain, not a dull brain. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=301))
- without virtue there is no foundation for clear thinking. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=316))
- The problem then is: Is it possible for a mind that has been so conditioned—brought up in innumerable sects, religions, and all the superstitions, fears—to break away from itself and thereby bring about a new mind? ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=319))
- you must completely destroy the fiction, because the old mind is the mind that is frightened, is ambitious, is fearful of death, of living, and of relationship; and it is always, consciously or unconsciously, seeking a permanency, security. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=326))
- We crave to be certain, to be right, to be successful, to know; and this desire for certainty, for permanence, builds up within ourselves the authority of personal experience, ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=331))
- What is important is not how to recognize one who is liberated but how to understand yourself. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=341))
- without self-knowledge there is no liberation from ignorance, from sorrow. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=342))
- Authority of any kind is blinding, it breeds thoughtlessness; ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=352))
- Authority engenders power, and power always becomes centralized and therefore utterly corrupting; it corrupts not only the wielder of power, but also him who follows it. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=353))
- But can I rely on my experience, on my judgment, on my analysis? ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=364))
- there can only be one state in which reality, newness, can come into being, which brings about a revolution. That state is when the mind is completely empty of the past, when there is no analyzer, no experience, no judgment, no authority of any kind. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=368))
- it would be a mistake, surely, to think that one can know oneself significantly, completely, fully, through isolation, ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=375))
- Self-knowledge is obviously a process, not an end in itself; and to know oneself, one must be aware of oneself in action, which is relationship. You discover yourself, not in isolation, not in withdrawal, but in relationship—in relationship to society, to your wife, your husband, your brother, to man; but to discover how you react, what your responses are, requires an extraordinary alertness of mind, a keenness of perception. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=377))
- the mind can be quiet only when it is simple, when it is no longer storing up, condemning, judging, weighing. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=420))
- For truth to come, belief, knowledge, experiencing, virtue, pursuit of virtue—which is different from being virtuous—all this must go. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=548))
- the mind that is confused will only create more confusion, more problems and conflict. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=590))
- To escape from that fear—that fear of emptiness, that fear of loneliness, that fear of stagnation, of not arriving, not succeeding, not achieving, not being something, not becoming something—is surely one of the reasons, is it not, why we accept beliefs so eagerly and greedily? ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=640))
- So long as that loneliness is not really understood, felt, penetrated, dissolved—whatever word you may like to use—so long as that sense of loneliness remains, dependence is inevitable, and one can never be free; ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=838))
- The willingness to be nothing ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=872))
- The desire to use others for your psychological necessities makes for dependence, and when you depend you must hold, possess; ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=880))
- Whatever we do on the periphery must inevitably create a problem, ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1274))
- With us, when we love, in it there is possessiveness, dominance, or subservience. ([Location 1283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1283))
- Possessiveness, then, is not love. Nor is love sentimental. To be sentimental, to be emotional, excludes love. ([Location 1284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1284))
- When you say you love someone, all that is implied: envy, the desire to possess, the desire to own, to dominate, the fear of loss, and so on. ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1293))
- When do you think about the person whom you love? You think about her when she is gone, when she is away, when she has left you…. So, you miss the person whom you say you love only when you are disturbed, when you are in suffering; ([Location 1296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1296))
- It is the man with no love in his heart who talks of rights and duties, ([Location 1308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1308))
- Licentiousness is not chaste, it leads only to degradation, to misery. So does the pursuit of an ideal. Both exclude love, both imply becoming something, indulging in something; and therefore you become important, and where you are important, love is not. ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1334))
- A disciplined heart, a suppressed heart, cannot know what love is. ([Location 1375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1375))
- Only when the mind and heart are unburdened of fear, of the routine of sensational habits, when there is generosity and compassion, there is love. Such love is chaste. ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1377))
- The end may be, but the means is. ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1383))
- you cannot love something if you resent it, if you have ideas, conclusions about it. ([Location 1386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1386))
- A mind that is passionate is inquiring, searching, looking, asking, demanding, not merely trying to find for its discontent some object in which it can fulfill itself and go to sleep. ([Location 1452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SE7ZGW&location=1452))
