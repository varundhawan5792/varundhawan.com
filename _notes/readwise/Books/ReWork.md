## Highlights
- This real world sounds like an awfully depressing place to live. It’s a place where new ideas, unfamiliar approaches, and foreign concepts always lose. The only things that win are what people already know and do, even if those things are flawed and inefficient. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=139))
- Contrast that with learning from your successes. Success gives you real ammunition. When something succeeds, you know what worked—and you can do it again. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=160))
- Evolution doesn’t linger on past failures, it’s always building upon what worked. So should you. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=167))
- And you have to be able to improvise. You have to be able to pick up opportunities that come along. Sometimes you need to say, “We’re going in a new direction because that’s what makes sense today.” ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=176))
- Decide what you’re going to do this week, not this year. Figure out the next most important thing and do that. Make decisions right before you do something, not far in advance. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=183))
- Grow slow and see what feels right—premature hiring is the death of many companies. And avoid huge growth spurts too—they can cause you to skip right over your appropriate size. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=198))
- while small businesses wish they were bigger, big businesses dream about being more agile and flexible? ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=201))
- Not only is this workaholism unnecessary, it’s stupid. Working more doesn’t mean you care more or get more done. It just means you work more. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=211))
- Workaholics miss the point, too. They try to fix problems by throwing sheer hours at them. They try to make up for intellectual laziness with brute force. This results in inelegant solutions. They even create crises. They don’t look for ways to be more efficient because they actually like working overtime. They enjoy feeling like heroes. They create problems (often unwittingly) just so they can get off on working more. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=214))
- You don’t need an MBA, a certificate, a fancy suit, a briefcase, or an above-average tolerance for risk. You just need an idea, a touch of confidence, and a push to get started. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=232))
- Great businesses have a point of view, not just a product or service. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=306))
- If no one’s upset by what you’re saying, you’re probably not pushing hard enough. (And you’re probably boring, too.) ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=311))
- Standing for something isn’t just about writing it down. It’s about believing it and living it. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=348))
- You need a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=414))
- If you do manage to get a good thing going, keep it going. Good things don’t come around that often. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=424))
- the more massive an object, the more energy required to change its direction. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=429))
- The more expensive it is to make a change, the less likely you are to make it. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=433))
- Huge organizations can take years to pivot. They talk instead of act. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=434))
- There’s the stuff you could do, the stuff you want to do, and the stuff you have to do. The stuff you have to do is where you should begin. Start at the epicenter. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=486))
- The longer it takes to develop, the less likely it is to launch. ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=525))
- speed, simplicity, ease of use, and clarity are our focus. Those are timeless desires. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=566))
- This approach just recognizes that the best way to get there is through iterations. Stop imagining what’s going to work. Find out for real. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=624))
- Problems are usually pretty simple. We just imagine that they require hard solutions. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=675))
## New highlights added April 18, 2024 at 10:58 PM
- Culture is action, not words. ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=1430))
- The ability to change course is one of the big advantages of being small. Compared with larger competitors, you’re way more capable of making quick, sweeping changes. Big companies just can’t move that fast. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=1441))
- Rockstar environments develop out of trust, autonomy, and responsibility. They’re a result of giving people the privacy, workspace, and tools they deserve. ([Location 1453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=1453))
- When you treat people like children, you get children’s work. ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ELY7PG&location=1457))
