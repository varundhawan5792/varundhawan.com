## Highlights
- we seldom recognise these overreactions for what they really are: garbled manifestations of a partner’s tricky past that has not been fully understood or mutually discussed. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=192))
- grasp just how much of a role the ‘transference’ of past fears and anxieties plays in all of our behaviours. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=194))
- transference – a psychological phenomenon whereby a situation in the present elicits from us a response – generally extreme, intense or rigid in nature ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=211))
- We are drawing upon an old defence mechanism to respond to what feels like a very familiar threat. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=214))
- the pain was so intense at that time that we reacted by shutting down our capacities for affection. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=219))
- The unconscious mind is slow to realise that things have changed in the outer world but sadly quick to mistake one person for another, ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=224))
- transference provides a vantage point on some of the most frustrating behaviours that we ever have to meet with in relationships ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=232))
- feel sympathy and understanding where we might have only felt irritation. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=233))
- traumatised by a domineering father, might see it as a powerful figure viewed from below, with splayed feet, thick legs, heavy shoulders and the head bent forward as if poised for attack. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=245))
- A sign of maturity is to accept with good grace that we might be involved in multiple transferences, ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=267))
- be patient about the way people might get a bit odd when trying to express their needs in the beginning phases of love. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=281))
- somewhat flustered or tongue-tied. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=282))
- act sarcastically or coldly, not from indifference, but as a way to disguise a disturbingly powerful enthusiasm. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=283))
- in truth, the need for, yet fear of, rejection never ends. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=289))
- The trigger to insecurity can be apparently minuscule. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=293))
- Even after years with someone, there can be a hurdle of fear about asking for proof that we are wanted. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=296))
- Rather than requesting reassurance endearingly and laying out our longing with charm, we might instead mask our needs beneath some brusque and hurtful behaviours guaranteed to frustrate our aims. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=299))
- when the fear of rejection is denied, two major symptoms tend to show up. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=300))
- We want to get close to our partners but feel so anxious that we may be unwanted, we freeze them out instead. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=301))
- Or else we get controlling (what therapists call ‘anxious’). ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=306))
- We can’t force them to want us (even if we haven’t asked them to). So we try to control them procedurally. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=310))
- As a final recourse, we may ward off our vulnerability by denigrating the person who eludes us. We pick up on their weaknesses and complain about shortcomings. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=313))
- The prospect of having one’s points of fragility exposed once again to another person can get linked to some very dark memories of humiliation. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=323))
- It is a challenge to be around another person who might easily hurt us – and to keep on in the relationship despite the fact they do sometimes use their knowledge to strike out at us. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=326))
- The deep message is: ‘I’m terrified you don’t care about me’; ‘I’m worried you don’t love me enough to go easy on my sore spots, so I’m putting on some armour or making a pre-emptive strike’. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=330))
- it is a deeply garbled, deeply misleading yet genuine plea for tenderness. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=333))
- Tragically, our instinctive defensive moves are counterproductive. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=333))
- They seek to avoid one problem – humiliation – and end up creating another one: a very confused, disgruntled and annoyed partner. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=335))
- They sound like an angry lion but they are a scared child. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=338))
- it’s a terror of being hurt that leads us to our worst outbursts. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=339))
- What do we characteristically do when we need someone but aren’t able to reach them? Do we withdraw, attack or – this is so rare – explain our requirements in an un-frightened way? ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=341))
- The move involves a shift in interpretation. We can replace a harsh view of what they are doing with a more charitable (and probably more correct) one. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=346))
- make it clear just how healthy and mature it is to be fragile and in repeated need of reassurance – and at the same time, how difficult it is to reveal one’s vulnerable dependence. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=349))
- We can never be through with the requirement for acceptance. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=355))
- Insecurity is, in this area, a sign of well-being. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=356))
- It means we remain realistic enough to see that things could genuinely turn out badly – and are invested enough to care. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=357))
- ‘I really need you; do you still want me?’ should be the most normal of enquiries. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=359))
- We look upon their faults and wonder again and again why they are the way they are. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=366))
- we should always strive to see people’s weaknesses as the inevitable downside of certain merits that drew us to them, ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=369))
- It is impossible to have strengths without weaknesses. Every virtue has an associated weakness. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=383))
- We may well find people with different strengths, but they will also have a new litany of weaknesses. It’s always calming to take a moment to remind ourselves that perfect people simply don’t exist. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=389))
- It’s very touching that we live in a world where we have learned to be so kind to children: it would be even nicer if we learned to be a little more generous towards the childlike parts of one another. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=405))
- It means being charitable in translating things they say in terms of their deeper meaning: ‘you’re a bastard’ might actually be a way of trying to say ‘I feel under siege at work and I’m trying to tell myself I’m stronger and more independent than I really feel’; or ‘you just don’t get it, do you’ might mean ‘I’m terrified and frustrated and I don’t really know why. Please be strong.’ ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=424))
- Part of getting better at relationships means growing a little readier to do the latter and a little more aware of our unnatural and dangerous fixation on the former. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=450))
- In a secret corner of our mind, we picture a lover who will anticipate our needs, read our hearts, act selflessly and make our world better and more complete. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=461))
- the only release from our longing for this sort of selfless one-directional love is to stop demanding it exclusively for ourselves and to learn – at times, when we have the energy and imagination – to give it to somebody else, ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=472))
- We should recognise how often relationships legitimately require us to put our own needs aside for a time in order to minister to another’s suffering. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=477))
- They are unlikely to give much thought, however, to the question of who will do the ironing. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=484))
- who one should visit at the weekend, what time to go to bed, how often one should have friends over for dinner and who should buy detergent. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=494))
- Long-running, highly stressful domestic anxiety often circles around what look like pedantic details. What is the right way to cook a chicken? Should newspapers be kept in the bathroom? ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=507))
- What actually causes panic is a difficulty that hasn’t been budgeted for ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=515))
- It’s rather about assuming that they are going to happen and that they will inevitably require quite a lot of time and thought to address. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=518))
- accepting a role for learning and teaching in love belongs to one of the fundamental principles of mature relationships. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=526))
- The idea of wanting to change our partners sounds incongruous and disturbing because, collectively, we have been deeply influenced by a particular aspect of the Romantic conception of love. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=534))
- the capacity to accept another person in their totality, in all their good and bad sides ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=537))
- love is first and foremost an admiration for the good sides, the perfections, of another human being. Love is the excitement we feel when we come face-to-face with something that is strong, clever, kind, honest, witty or magnanimous in another person. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=551))
- being awed by another person for all the sort of things about them that truly are right and accomplished. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=554))
- For the Greeks, given that we are all very imperfect, part of what it means to deepen love is to want to teach – and to be taught. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=560))
- Two people should see a relationship as a constant opportunity to improve and be improved. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=561))
- We should stop feeling guilty for simply wanting to change our partners, and we should never resent our partners for simply wanting to change us. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=564))
- we tend to assume that we are being attacked and betrayed – and therefore close our ears to the instruction, reacting with sarcasm and aggression to the teacher. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=572))
- We should never feel ashamed of instructing or of needing instruction. The only fault is to reject the opportunity for education if it is offered – however clumsily. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=586))
- We retain highly ambitious ideas of what relationships are meant to be and what they will (eventually) be like for us ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=601))
- We weren’t compatible enough. So rather than adjust our ideas of what relationships are meant to be like, we shift our hopes to a new target on whom we can direct our recklessly elevated hopes. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=615))
- sulking combines intense anger with an intense desire not to communicate what one is angry about: one both desperately wants to be understood and yet is utterly committed to not explaining oneself plainly. ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=824))
- Good communication means the capacity to give another person an accurate picture of what is happening in our emotional and psychological lives ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=827))
- describe our very darkest, trickiest and most awkward sides in such a way that others can understand and even sympathise with ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=828))
- Over dinner with a partner, we might – for example – work our way gradually yet systematically through a list of difficult but important questions that we’d otherwise likely shelve or not find our way to: ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=846))
- A crush represents in pure and perfect form the dynamics of the Romantic philosophy: the explosive interaction of limited knowledge, outward obstacles to further discovery – and boundless hope. ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=897))
- Maturity doesn’t suggest we give up on crushes. ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=937))
- We need to swap the Romantic view for the tragic awareness, which states that every human can be guaranteed to frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us – and we will (without any malice) do the same to them. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=939))
- To start the list, here are just some of the unpalatable truths that stir in our minds: ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=978))
- We remain imprisoned, fearful and ashamed – with few options but to deceive for the sake of love. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZHFDB6&location=995))
