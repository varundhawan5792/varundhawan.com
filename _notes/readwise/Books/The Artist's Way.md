## Highlights
- Filling the well involves the active pursuit of images to refresh our artistic reservoirs. Art is born in attention. Its midwife is detail. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083X758NX&location=625))
- In filling the well, think magic. Think delight. Think fun. Do not think duty. Do not do what you should do—spiritual sit-ups like reading a dull but recommended critical text. Do what intrigues you, explore what interests you; think mystery, not mastery. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083X758NX&location=635))
- A mystery can be very simple: if I drive this road, not my usual road, what will I see? ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083X758NX&location=638))
- Any regular, repetitive action primes the well. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083X758NX&location=647))
