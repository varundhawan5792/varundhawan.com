## Highlights
- as the team grows, it might become necessary to split leadership into two — one person focused on creative matters, and the other on operational. There are many examples of such a split in other fields. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=546))
- Nothing beats going into people’s homes or offices, and following them as they go about their days. ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=568))
- Designers need to understand how their work contributes to business success. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=593))
- In reality, just because two people have the same title doesn’t mean they are interchangeable. Nor does any title describe the totality of what any person does. ([Location 1206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1206))
- Communication designers should be collaborating with product designers to ensure the coherence of this end-to-end experience. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1262))
- Generative research, typically field research such as in-home observations or diary studies, leads to insights for framing problems in new ways ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1272))
- Evaluative research tests the efficacy of designed solutions, through observing use and seeing where people have problems. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1273))
- Strong organizational skills and keen attention to detail are required, as much of UX research is operational management: screening and recruiting participants; scheduling them; note-taking and other data collection; and analysis and organization of that data. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1274))
- the UX research team should remain small, highly leveraged, and supportive of everyone else’s ability to engage with users directly. ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1280))
- within an iterative design and development context, most research efforts should be conducted by designers, product managers, and even engineers, with help from the UX research team. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1282))
- Bring on a Design Program Manager, someone with the explicit responsibility to keep design operations running smoothly. This person’s primary objective is to make the design organization as effective as possible by enabling designers to focus on the work. This means facilitating prioritization, identifying milestones, connecting similar workstreams, managing risk, streamlining communications, articulating standards for tools and processes, aligning schedules, and ensuring the team has the people and resources it needs. ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1290))
- operates at a strategic level, where it introduces design as a powerful tool with value to both the business, in helping to differentiate the company from competitors, and to customers, through guiding innovative and human-centered products, services, and brands. ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1300))
- some service-heavy environments, such as hospitality, financial services, and health care, will benefit from individuals dedicated to service design. ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1331))
- Whereas product designers typically work within Surface and Structure, service designers operate within Structure and Strategy, specifying the design of a system that will deliver a great service experience. ([Location 1333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1333))
- Design teams benefit from being able to engage with technology as part of the exploration of design solutions. ([Location 1339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1339))
- Many product designers have this skillset, which allows a design organization to grow for a while without warranting a dedicated creative technologist. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1344))
- The Creative Technologist is less concerned about delivery than possibility. They can be fast and loose with their code in a way that frontend developers cannot. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1351))
- Head of Design has emerged as a title for this role, which works regardless of whether they are considered a manager, director, or VP. ([Location 1364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1364))
- Design Managers must also be skilled practitioners. ([Location 1405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1405))
- The difference between a Design Manager and Design Director is either a matter of scale (directors might be managing other Design Managers, and have a broader purview) or seniority. ([Location 1409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KU8O23M&location=1409))
