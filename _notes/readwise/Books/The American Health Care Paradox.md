## Highlights
- Americans who are white, insured, college educated, and upper income have poorer health than do their counterparts in other industrialized countries. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=184))
- The American spirit resists the thought that the nation may not be getting value for money. The situation is upsetting not only because it connotes waste in the system, but because it provides evidence of the United States’ falling behind its peer, industrialized countries—spending more but not being any healthier for it. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=199))
- According to 2010 data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, it is allocated as follows: approximately 31 percent is for hospital care; 20 percent, for physician and clinic services; 10 percent, for prescription drugs; ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=205))
- Government programs cover about 45 percent of total spending in the United States, primarily through Medicare and Medicaid, implemented in the mid-1960s. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=214))
- Medicare commonly insures older people with acute care needs ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=215))
- Medicaid commonly insures people with lower incomes and disabilities, and people receiving nursing home care, ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=217))
- Many have attributed the failures of health care in delivering better outcomes at lower costs to several facets of the current approach. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=270))
    - Note: Drivers of high cost
- First, some have suggested that underinsurance has resulted in poor prevention and inadequate adherence to medical recommendations.20 Second, blame has been placed on fragmentation between public and private payers and inadequate primary care with fee-for-service arrangements that can result in unnecessary duplication and inefficiencies. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=271))
- (Fewer than 15 percent of all physicians practicing in the United States are primary care physicians ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=274))
- medical malpractice compel physicians to screen for every conceivable disease and use the most aggressive treatment ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=277))
- cultural demands for the most sophisticated medical technology ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=278))
- American health outcomes among insured populations still lag substantially behind those of other countries. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=285))
- medical homes are designed to reduce fragmentation and duplication and help individuals navigate the health care sector. These are physician-led, team-based health care delivery models that seek to provide comprehensive, continuous, and well-coordinated medical care to patients to maximize health outcomes. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=288))
- overall medical technology has added to national health care spending. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=318))

- Americans are not comfortable rationing anything that even one American might be able to afford. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=320))
    - Note: In the U.S., there is a strong cultural emphasis on individualism and the belief in the availability of resources and services based on one's ability to afford them. This mindset often translates into a resistance to the concept of rationing, which is the controlled distribution of scarce resources, services, or goods. Rationing is often associated with limitations and restrictions, which can be at odds with the American values of freedom and abundance.
- but to unravel the spend more, get less paradox, we need to look more closely at what is (and is not) commonly being measured. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=328))
- health expenditure to mean all spending on the final consumption of health goods and services plus capital investment in health care infrastructure. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=330))
- The houses and neighborhoods people live in, the food people eat, the air people breathe, the amount of exercise people get, and the jobs people have all influence their health. Yet, none of these inputs is captured by the calculation of national health care expenditure. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=338))
- Without formal training in housing, nutritional education or social work, physicians routinely assess medical histories and make medical diagnoses, ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=962))
- Nurses, who are perhaps closest to patients’ day-to-day issues, hear about the realities of people’s social circumstances and recognize that medical care is just one small input to health and well-being. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=964))
- Physicians further reported that had they the power to write prescriptions to address social needs, these prescriptions would represent one out of every seven they write. ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=988))
- The top social needs physicians noted were fitness (75 percent of respondents), nutritional food (64 percent), employment assistance (52 percent), education (49 percent), and housing (43 percent). ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=989))
- They consistently described the awkwardness of detecting patients’ social service needs and wanting to be responsive to their concerns, while knowing that their skills were inadequate to solve the problems and costly to employ. ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=992))
- Many physicians reported feeling overtaxed and undertrained to identify and meet the social needs of patients, and patients themselves may prefer to conceal deeper social issues in favor of a seemingly quicker medical fix. ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1003))
- FRONT-LINE PERSONNEL ARE STRETCHED TO RESPOND TO PATIENT CONCERNS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1054))
- Fighting a rising tide of paperwork and bureaucracy, providers of health care, whether physicians, nurses, or administrators, say that time has become a scarce resource of which they have far too little. ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1057))
- They recall why they went into medicine—their desire to listen to patients and to have the skills necessary to help them feel better. ([Location 1059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1059))
- Honestly, it’s hard to do; it’s hard to invest a lot of energy in the backstory in the midst of the busy shift. ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1069))
- less than a third of clinicians’ time in the emergency department is spent in direct patient care. The majority is spent on indirect patient care, including ordering tests, completing medical records, and arranging services; ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1072))
- the average time a patient spends with the physician at a primary care visit is less than 15 minutes,19 and nearly half of a primary care physician’s time is spent on documentation and follow-up, outside the examination room without the patient present. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1076))
- Most doctor’s offices are open an average of thirty to forty hours a week, and host practices of approximately 2,500 patients.22 On the basis of recommendations from national clinical care guidelines for preventive services and chronic disease management, sufficiently addressing the needs of this size practice would require 21.7 working hours per day. ([Location 1081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1081))
- But we have more data, too. Still, there are too many alerts. It is so noisy. There is an alert for everything, and you get numb to it. If you stopped [to pay attention to] everything, it would really take forever, so sometimes you just click right by them. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1087))
- This system is so saturated with people that are burnt out that I think, after a while, you tend to forget that you’re helping humans. ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1108))
- many aspired to a type of care called “holistic” in nature. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1113))
- it applies to modern-day efforts to address individuals’ physical, emotional, social, and even spiritual dimensions of health. ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1114))
- it is not surprising that reductionist and mechanistic approaches to medicine, which focus on eliminating disease rather than producing health in the WHO’s definition of health, dominate. Paradoxically, the United States’ overgrown investment in medicine combined with its inadequate attention to the many other inputs to well-being may itself be compromising people’s health. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1122))
- You can’t take care of [people] unless you can, one, figure out how to go to them before they come to you because if you wait for them to come to you, it’s the emergency room that you’ll see them in. Two, it requires a relationship, and relationships take time, and nobody pays for that time. Three, you have to stick with it.31 ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XN5G1DS&location=1146))
