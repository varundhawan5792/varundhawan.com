## Highlights
- If you’re affecting how a product works in any way whatsoever—you’re designing. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=127))
- What we choose to design and more importantly, what we choose not to design and, even more importantly, who we exclude from the design process—these are all political acts. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=129))
- “You are responsible for what you put into the world. And you are responsible for the effects those things have upon the world.” ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=132))
- Never do work you’re ashamed of putting your name on. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=149))
- The world isn’t usually changed by special people. It’s changed by ordinary people who take it upon themselves to take a stand because they’re trying to lead ordinary lives and something stupid gets in their way. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=179))
- Every human being on this planet is obligated to do their best to leave this planet in better shape than we found it. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=246))
- You are responsible for what you put into the world. The work you produce has your name on it. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=252))
- We need to fear the consequences of our work more than we love the cleverness of our ideas. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=258))
- When you are hired to design something, it is for your expertise. Your job is not just to produce that work but to evaluate the impact of that work. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=266))
- If it’s impossible to eliminate the negative impact of the work, it’s your job to stop it from seeing the light of day. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=268))
- Saying no is a design skill. Asking why is a design skill. Rolling your eyes and staying quiet is not. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=271))
- Asking ourselves why we are making something is an infinitely better question than asking ourselves whether we can make it. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=272))
- you should encourage criticism in order to create better work in the future. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=274))
- Criticism is a gift. It makes good work better. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=277))
- criticism should be asked for and welcomed at every step of the design process. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=278))
- Design is the intentional solution to a problem within a set of constraints. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=280))
- your team should strive to reflect those people—even better your team should include those people. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=282))
- A team with a single point of view will never understand the constraints they need to design for as well as a team with multiple points of view. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=284))
- Empathy is a pretty word for exclusion. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=285))
- For years we referred to people who weren’t crucial to our products’ success as “edge cases.” We were marginalizing people. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=289))
- Never throw another designer under the bus to advance your own agenda. This includes public redesigns of someone else’s work, spec work, unsolicited work, and plagiarism. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=302))
- Diversity leads to better outcomes and solutions. Diversity leads to better design. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=307))
- make room for those who have been silenced. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=309))
- Not hiring someone because they’re not a good cultural fit is either elitist, racist, or sexist, or all three. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=310))
- Take the time for self-reflection every few months, or after every project. Evaluate the decisions you’ve made recently. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=313))
- We have a skill-set that people need in order to get things made, and that skill-set includes an inquiring mind and a strong spine. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=399))
- What passes through that gate carries our seal of approval. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=403))
- The worst of what we create will outlive us. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=405))
- While there’s certainly something to be said for speed, excessive speed tends to blur one’s purpose. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=410))
- People don’t see the things they’re rewarded for as problems to fix. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=434))
- It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=440))
- Your job, the glorious job you signed up for when you said you wanted to be a designer, is to support all of these people. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=552))
- Venture capital is like startup cocaine. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=596))
- We don’t build businesses for the long haul anymore, at least not the venture-backed ones. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=625))
- I got mine. Fuck you. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=629))
- In short, a veil of ignorance is a way of determining whether what you’re designing, be it a startup, a dinner plan, or a system of government, is just. It’s very simple: when designing something, imagine that your relationship to that system gets determined after you’ve made it. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=631))
- There is no such thing as neutral software. We all bring our own biases to the things we design—our own ethical code, and our own garbage. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=647))
- Who we work for and how we do that work are the only things that matter right now. ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=657))
- When no one else around you is asking the hard questions, when no one else around you is standing up for the people who entrust their personal information and their relationship statuses to your service… that’s when we need you the most. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=706))
- One of the best designers I ever worked with had a psychology degree. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=837))
- They lacked a basic understanding of how businesses work, how to research a problem, how to measure the impact of their work, how to present work effectively, and how to take criticism. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=849))
- It’s not easy to tell the CEO of a Fortune 500 company that the product they just asked you to design is harmful. It takes more than guts. It takes knowing what questions to ask. It takes knowing how to test the effects of the product. It takes knowing how to build a good argument. And it takes seeing yourself as an equal stakeholder in the product. It takes seeing yourself as a gatekeeper. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=871))
- they confuse solving design problems with personal expression. ([Location 881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=881))
- Anyone who wants a career as a designer is going to need to speak about someone’s business and organizational goals. They’re going to have to learn how to analyze data, and how to measure effectiveness. They’re going to have to learn how to build and extend brands and to do goal-driven work. Most of all, they need to learn how to measure the effectiveness of their own work. ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=888))
- up to the people and companies they work with. We need to build designers who understand their job is not to be a pair of hands, but to be society’s gatekeepers. We need to train designers who aren’t afraid to ask why and say no. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=900))
- software companies who make the tools are a huge under-acknowledged source of design education to make up for what the schools aren’t doing; and continuing professional education. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=905))
- an educational program that handles people doing complex and dangerous work: ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=909))
- The trick to not being stressed out about getting fired is to expect it every day. Work toward it. Be willing to say the thing that might get you fired, because if you’re not, then you’re holding back. ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=935))
- The truth is that design, when it comes to digital products, is a team sport. Designing a complex tool well takes people from a lot of different fields. Be they engineers, strategists, developers, or yes, designers. ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=973))
- Design is a verb, an act. ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=983))
- Engineers design things all the time. What a professional designer brings to the act is intention. But in order to do that, the designer needs to behave intentionally. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=986))
- Today’s designers need to be systems thinkers, experts in regulation, collaborators, communicators, and fearless. ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=992))
- She includes the people who need to be included in the design process, especially the ones who’ve been excluded in the past. She does this with authority. With agency. With good communication. And with conviction. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=998))
- You will design things that fit within your own experiences. ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1025))
- Personally, I like to earn things. I wanna know that when I got a job it was because I beat everyone, not just the people you allowed in the room. ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1082))
- I mean you should say “You interrupted Maria. I want to hear her finish.” Not because I think Maria needs saving, but because it’s important for the other guys in the room to see that this is not longer tolerated by their own. ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1148))
- write the job description so that it emphasized the work they’d be doing; to talk about the people they’d be working with, the community they’d be joining, and why that work was important to be doing. They suggested talking about how this hire would be complementing an already great team. They suggested emphasizing the company’s goals rather than individual achievement, and how rather than saying things like “you need five years experience doing x,” you’re better off with “be ready to discuss how your previous experiences can help us do x”. ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1166))
- Perhaps, just perhaps, the point of life is to earn the death that comes at the end. ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1251))
- If you want to do good work, start doing it at your day job. Start asking questions about what you’re building. ([Location 1289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1289))
- I get that you don’t want to lose your job, and I get that you have rent to pay, but earning your living at the expense of someone else’s livelihood, or life, is not a good way to live. ([Location 1296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1296))
- You cannot afford to be neutral. Right now, more than ever, you need to reach down deep into your core, find your ethical strength, and bring it to your day job with you every day. ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1301))
- The problem comes when theft goes from being an emergency method to stave off starvation to the primary means through which you earn your income. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1441))
- BE THE EXPERT ([Location 1511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1511))
- People hire you to be the expert, so you might as well be the expert. Tell those people what it’s going to take to do your job and how you’re going to do it. ([Location 1521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1521))
- The minute you start saying things like, “I’m here for your approval,” all of that goes out the window. ([Location 1534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1534))
- remove subjective and reductive language from our vocabulary. Part of the problem here is the myth of imposter syndrome. ([Location 1535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1535))
- You work for the people who’ll ultimately come in contact with your work. ([Location 1549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1549))
- You got it when they hired you, although you may have to remind the people who pay you once in a while. ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1556))
- We want to create an environment with as many different experiences, viewpoints, and ways of looking at the world and solving problems as possible. ([Location 1595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1595))
- Making money is a requirement of starting and maintaining a business, but it’s not a goal. ([Location 1635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1635))
- “This right here is broken” is good feedback. ([Location 1687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PS16XY9&location=1687))
