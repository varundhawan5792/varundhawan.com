## Highlights
- We don’t have to be the people our parents raised us to be. We need to be the people our children need us to be. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08R27HH9X&location=324))
- We did the celestial version of running across the street to get a photo with all of us in the shot. And in that shot, if we look closely, we’ll see a bunch of people trying to live both ordinary and extraordinary lives.

- as long as our definition of we gets a little bit bigger every day, and our definition of them gets a little bit smaller every day—we have a chance. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08R27HH9X&location=370))
- There are two words every designer needs to feel comfortable saying. No and why. Those words are the foundation of what we do. They’re the foundation of building an ethical framework. If we cannot ask “why,” we lose the ability to judge whether the work we’re doing is ethical. If we cannot say “no,” we lose the ability to stand and fight. We lose the ability to help shape the thing we’re responsible for shaping. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08R27HH9X&location=420))
- What a professional designer brings to the act is intention. But for that, the designer needs to behave intentionally. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08R27HH9X&location=510))
- There’s no minimal viable product in architecture because bad architecture kills people. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08R27HH9X&location=561))
- Bad UX is now just as deadly. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08R27HH9X&location=562))
- Let’s not spend the next ten years looking for the perfect solution at the cost of implementing a good one. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08R27HH9X&location=564))
- You can either hope you don’t get in trouble, or not give a fuck if you get in trouble. Hope isn’t going to solve our problems. But not giving a fuck just might. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08R27HH9X&location=627))
