## Highlights
- the difference between a good designer and a great designer is in their ability to not only solve problems with design, but to also articulate how their solution solves it in a way that’s compelling, fosters agreement, and gets the support needed to move forward.

- Communicating about the designs was more important than the designs themselves. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=326))
- I may not know how to play an instrument, but I can decide what music I like ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=355))
- when your job is to create the user interface, everyone is going to care about everything that you do! ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=361))
- we must take responsibility for showing people how and why our work is so valuable. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=363))
- sometimes no matter how hard we try, the home page just becomes a huge mess. Everyone wants their business unit represented on the home page. It’s as if something doesn’t exist if it isn’t on the home page. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=386))
- Ultimately, I’m only going to pursue candidates who can communicate well, and so the poor communicators are passed over very quickly. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=401))
- there are three things that every design needs to be successful: It solves a problem. It’s easy for users. It’s supported by everyone. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=449))
- Find out what the most important factors are for your stakeholders—impressions, conversion, account sign-ups—and then pick one or two measurable issues that you’d like to improve and write them down. Set this as your goal and use it to your advantage when talking to other people. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=462))
- The hard part, though, is figuring out what drives that intuition. What makes this “feel right” so that we can help other people see our perspective? ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=468))
- When you’re working on a design, you need to make yourself consciously aware of every decision you’re making and why. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=471))
- One way that I capture how my designs affect users is to write a story that is either based on a user session I observed or loosely based on the overall use case. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=538))
- Simplified, usability is about two things: common sense and research. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=551))
- You really have no choice but to make your best guess about what will work for the user. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=552))
- Create the easiest solution you can think of. Do what makes sense and move on. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=554))
- Of course, what you think makes sense and what a user does are quite often two different things. That’s why we have research ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=555))
- We’re looking for their support—of us, our expertise, our solution, or our plan for moving forward. It’s possible to get stakeholder support even if they disagree with our solution. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=576))
- Everything we design has another way of doing it. ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=581))
- It’s not just who you know; it’s the quality of those relationships, too. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FVV7PDN&location=625))
