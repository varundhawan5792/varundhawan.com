## Highlights
- Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=230))
- all the positive and happy self-help stuff we hear all the time—is actually fixating on what you lack. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=235))
- TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more—buy ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=247))
- The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=254))
- Wanting positive experience is a negative experience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience. It’s what the philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as “the backwards law”—the ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=304))
- You and everyone you know are going to be dead soon. And in the short amount of time between here and there, you have a limited amount of fucks to give. Very few, in fact. And if you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought or choice—well, then you’re going to get fucked. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=352))
- it is perhaps the most worthy struggle one can undertake in one’s life. It is perhaps the only struggle in one’s life. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=358))
- people often attempt to be indifferent because in reality they give way too many fucks. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=373))
- The question, then, is, What do we give a fuck about? ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=381))
- the willingness to be different, an outcast, a pariah, all for the sake of one’s own values. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=392))
- You can’t be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=399))
- The point isn’t to get away from the shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=402))
- If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you—your ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=416))
- chances are you don’t have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=418))
- finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=422))
- Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=435))
- Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature and, as we’ll see, necessary components to creating consistent happiness. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=513))
- Problems never stop; they merely get exchanged and/or upgraded. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=572))
- To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action; ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=576))
- True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving. ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=581))
- Forms of blame and denial give us a quick high. They are a way to temporarily escape our problems, ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=593))
- Highs also generate addiction. The more you rely on them to feel better about your underlying problems, the more you will seek them out. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=599))
- They’re feedback mechanisms telling us that something is either likely right or likely wrong for us—nothing more, nothing less. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=604))
- negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it’s because you’re supposed to do something. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=610))
- Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action. When you feel them, life seems simple and there is nothing else to do but enjoy it. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=611))
- we shouldn’t always trust our own emotions. In fact, I believe we should make a habit of questioning them. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=615))
- many of these repressed individuals struggle to deal with problems throughout their lives. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=618))
- A fixation on happiness inevitably amounts to a never-ending pursuit of “something else”—a new house, a new relationship, another child, another pay raise. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=626))
- The person you marry is the person you fight with. The house you buy is the house you repair. The dream job you take is the job you stress over. Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice—whatever ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=630))
- a question that most people never consider, is, “What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?” ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=643))
- happiness requires struggle. It grows from problems. Joy doesn’t just sprout out of the ground like daisies and rainbows. ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=651))
- the solution lies in the acceptance and active engagement of that negative experience—not the avoidance of it, not the salvation from it. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=654))
- People want a partner, a spouse. But you don’t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections, building the sexual tension that never gets released, and staring blankly at a phone that never rings. It’s part of the game of love. You can’t win if you don’t play. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=660))
- it took me a long time and a lot of struggle to finally figure out why: I didn’t actually want it. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=676))
- I was in love with the result—the ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=677))
- but I wasn’t in love with the process. And because of that, I failed at it. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=678))
- It turns out that adversity and failure are actually useful and even necessary for developing strong-minded and successful adults. ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=731))
- a true and accurate measurement of one’s self-worth is how people feel about the negative aspects of themselves. ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=739))
- Jimmy is entitled. That is, he feels as though he deserves good things without actually earning them. ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=742))
- the problem with entitlement is that it makes people need to feel good about themselves all the time, even at the expense of those around them. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=753))
- People who feel entitled view every occurrence in their life as either an affirmation of, or a threat to, their own greatness. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=760))
- The true measurement of self-worth is not how a person feels about her positive experiences, but rather how she feels about her negative experiences. ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=766))
- A person who actually has a high self-worth is able to look at the negative parts of his character frankly—“Yes, sometimes I’m irresponsible with money,” “Yes, sometimes I exaggerate my own successes,” “Yes, I rely too much on others to support me and should be more self-reliant”—and then acts to improve upon them. ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=769))
- The deeper the pain, the more helpless we feel against our problems, and the more entitlement we adopt to compensate for those problems. ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=874))
- The truth is that there’s no such thing as a personal problem. If you’ve got a problem, chances are millions of other people have had it in the past, ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=886))
- Often, it’s this realization—that you and your problems are actually not privileged in their severity or pain—that is the first and most important step toward solving them. ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=890))
- To become truly great at something, you have to dedicate shit-tons of time and energy to it. And because we all have limited time and energy, few of us ever become truly exceptional at more than one thing, if anything at all. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=907))
- because we’re all quite average most of the time, the deluge of exceptional information drives us to feel pretty damn insecure and desperate, ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=923))
- more and more we feel the need to compensate through entitlement and addiction. ([Location 924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=924))
- The Internet has not just open-sourced information; it has also open-sourced insecurity, self-doubt, and shame. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=941))
- The ticket to emotional health, like that to physical health, comes from eating your veggies—that is, accepting the bland and mundane truths of life: ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=963))
- “The vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that’s okay.” This vegetable course will taste bad at first. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=965))
- the knowledge and acceptance of your own mundane existence will actually free you to accomplish what you truly wish to accomplish, ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=968))
- life’s basic experiences: the pleasures of simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about. ([Location 970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=970))
- Humans often choose to dedicate large portions of their lives to seemingly useless or destructive causes. ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1037))
- These men both chose how they wished to suffer. ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1044))
- To both men, their suffering meant something; it fulfilled some greater cause. And because it meant something, they were able to endure it, or perhaps even enjoy it. ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1045))
- the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1063))
- We all have emotional blind spots. Often they have to do with the emotions that we were taught were inappropriate growing up. ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1077))
- The second layer of the self-awareness onion is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions. ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1079))
- This layer of questioning helps us understand the root cause of the emotions that overwhelm us. Once we understand that root cause, we can ideally do something to change ([Location 1084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1084))
- The third level is our personal values: ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1086))
- our values determine the nature of our problems, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives. ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1089))
- If what we value is unhelpful, if what we consider success/failure is poorly chosen, then everything based upon those values—the thoughts, the emotions, the day-to-day feelings—will all be out of whack. ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1091))
- the more uncomfortable the answer, the more likely it is to be true. ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1109))
- We get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them, ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1143))
- The trick with negative emotions is to 1) express them in a socially acceptable and healthy manner and 2) express them in a way that aligns with your values. ([Location 1254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1254))
- Some examples of good, healthy values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1282))
- What are the values that you prioritize above everything else, and that therefore influence your decision-making more than anything else? ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1293))
- The rest of this book is dedicated to five counterintuitive values that I believe are the most beneficial values one can adopt. ([Location 1312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1312))
- taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1315))
- acknowledgement of your own ignorance ([Location 1316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1316))
- willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1317))
- ability to both say and hear no, ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1318))
- contemplation of one’s own mortality; this one is crucial, because paying vigilant attention to one’s own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective. ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1318))
- “With great responsibility comes great power.” The more we choose to accept responsibility in our lives, the more power we will exercise over our lives. ([Location 1403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1403))
- What he didn’t realize was that he had chosen the value that was hurting him: height. Women, he assumed, are attracted only to height. He was screwed, no matter what he did. ([Location 1411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1411))
- There are far better values that he could have adopted in his dating life. “I want to date only women who like me for who I am” might have been a nice place to start—a ([Location 1413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1413))
- This is the way fault works in our society: if you fuck up, you’re on the hook for making it right. And it should be that way. ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1423))
- But there are also problems that we aren’t at fault for, yet we are still responsible for them. ([Location 1424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1424))
- Fault is past tense. Responsibility is present tense. Fault results from choices that have already been made. Responsibility results from the choices you’re currently making, ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1433))
- it was now my own responsibility to make myself happy again. ([Location 1451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1451))
- I get that my values suck and that I avoid responsibility for all of my problems and that I’m an entitled little shit who thinks the world should revolve around me and every inconvenience I experience—but how do I change?” ([Location 1611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1611))
- in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else. ([Location 1614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1614))
- Giving up a value you’ve depended on for years is going to feel disorienting, as if you don’t really know right from wrong anymore. This is hard, but it’s normal. ([Location 1621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1621))
- ever reaching truth or perfection. We shouldn’t seek to find the ultimate “right” answer for ourselves, but rather, we should seek to chip away at the ways that we’re wrong today so that we can be a little less wrong tomorrow. ([Location 1659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1659))
- A certain woman is single and lonely and wants a partner, but she never gets out of the house ([Location 1671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1671))
- They’re told that they’re afraid of failure, of rejection, of someone saying no. But that’s not it. ([Location 1673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1673))
- That woman doesn’t get out there and date because she would be forced to confront her beliefs about her own desirability. ([Location 1675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1675))
- It’s easier to sit in a painful certainty ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1677))
- Our minds are constantly whirring, generating more and more associations to help us understand and control the environment around us. ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1723))
- the more you try to be certain about something, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel. ([Location 1806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1806))
- openness to being wrong must exist for any real change or growth to take place. ([Location 1817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1817))
- The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it. ([Location 1826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1826))
- There’s a certain comfort that comes with knowing how you fit in the world. Anything that shakes up that comfort—even if it could potentially make your life better—is inherently scary. ([Location 1829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1829))
- Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change. ([Location 1856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1856))
- I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1860))
- let go of the idea that “you” exist at all; ([Location 1863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1863))
- don’t be special; don’t be unique. ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1880))
- measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator. ([Location 1881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1881))
- The narrower and rarer the identity you choose for yourself, the more everything will seem to threaten you. ([Location 1882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1882))
- the simple act of asking ourselves such questions generates the humility and compassion needed to resolve a lot of our issues. ([Location 1906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1906))
- just because you ask yourself if you have the wrong idea doesn’t necessarily mean that you do. ([Location 1907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1907))
- The goal is merely to ask the question and entertain the thought at the moment, not to hate yourself. ([Location 1909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1909))
- The goal here is to look at which problem is better. ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1931))
- pain is part of the process. It’s important to feel it. Because if you just chase after highs to cover up the pain, if you continue to indulge in entitlement and delusional positive thinking, if you continue to overindulge in various substances or activities, then you’ll never generate the requisite motivation to actually change. ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2057))
- VCR questions are funny because the answer appears difficult to anyone who has them and appears easy to anyone who does not. ([Location 2079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2079))
- Because I failed to separate what I felt from what was, I was incapable of stepping outside myself and seeing the world for what it was: a simple place where two people can walk up to each other at any time and speak. ([Location 2092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2092))
- When you choose a new value, you are choosing to introduce a new form of pain into your life. Relish it. Savor it. Welcome it with open arms. Then act despite it. ([Location 2097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2097))
- Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of it. ([Location 2126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2126))
- The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility, and 2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner. ([Location 2302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2302))
- Wherever there is a healthy and loving relationship, there will be clear boundaries between the two people and their values, and there will be an open avenue of giving and receiving rejection when necessary. ([Location 2306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2306))
- People can’t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn’t try, because that won’t make you happy. You can’t solve other people’s problems for them either, because that likewise won’t make them happy. ([Location 2336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2336))
- a healthy relationship is when two people solve their own problems in order to feel good about each other. ([Location 2339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2339))
- These are the yin and yang of any toxic relationship: the victim and the saver, the person who starts fires because it makes her feel important and the person who puts out fires because it makes him feel important. ([Location 2346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2346))

- building a track record for trust takes time—certainly a lot more time than it takes to break trust. And during that trust-building period, things are likely to be pretty shitty. ([Location 2434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2434))
- When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen: 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them, and 2) the trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved behavior over time. ([Location 2437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2437))
- the more options we’re given, the less satisfied we become with whatever we choose, because we’re aware of all the other options we’re potentially forfeiting. ([Location 2448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2448))
- pursuing a breadth of experience denies us the opportunity to experience the rewards of depth of experience. ([Location 2457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2457))

- in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our physical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever. This is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings, ([Location 2587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2587))

- our immortality projects are our values. ([Location 2604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2604))
- we’re all driven by fear to give way too many fucks about something, because giving a fuck about something is the only thing that distracts us from the reality and inevitability of our own death. ([Location 2605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2605))
