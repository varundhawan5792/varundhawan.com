## Highlights
- But there’s another meaning of happiness that’s radically different: the experience of living a rich and meaningful life. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=213))
- behaving like the sort of person we really want to be, doing the things that matter deep in our hearts, moving in life directions we consider worthy ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=215))
- it is a powerful sense of a life well lived. The ancient Greek word for this type of happiness is ‘eudemonia’, these days often translated as ‘flourishing’. When we live our lives in this way, we will, for sure, have many pleasurable feelings; ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=217))
- At times, we do things we that help us move towards the sort of life we want; let’s call these behaviours ‘towards moves’. And at other times, we do things that take us away from the sort of life we want; let’s call these behaviours ‘away moves’. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=252))
- Basically, towards moves are things you say and do — no matter how small they may be — that enhance your life; that make it richer, fuller and more meaningful. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=262))
- Away moves can also include things we do ‘inside our heads’ (technically known as ‘cognitive processes’) such as worrying, ruminating, obsessing and overanalysing. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=267))
- away moves are things we say and do that make our lives worse, keep us stuck, exacerbate our problems, inhibit our growth, negatively impact our relationships, or impair our health and wellbeing in the long term. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=269))
- Any activity can be a towards move or an away move, depending on the situation. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=279))
- If what you’re doing in a particular situation is helping you move closer towards the life you want to build, we say it’s ‘workable’ (a towards move); but if it’s having the opposite effect, we say it’s ‘unworkable’ (an away move). ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=296))
- Now unfortunately, when difficult thoughts and feelings arise, we easily get ‘hooked’ by them — much like a fish on the end of a line. We get hooked in two main ways, that usually overlap with each other. Let’s call these ‘OBEY mode’ and ‘STRUGGLE mode’. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=309))
- When we OBEY our thoughts and feelings, we either give them so much attention that we can’t usefully focus on anything else, or we allow them to tell us what to do. The thought ‘It’s hopeless’ hooks us and we OBEY: we give up, we stop trying. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=313))
- In STRUGGLE mode, we actively try to stop our thoughts and feelings from dominating us. We STRUGGLE against them; we do whatever we can to avoid them, escape from them, suppress them, or get rid of them. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=319))
- When our thoughts and feelings ‘hook’ us, they reel us in, jerk us around and pull us into away moves. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=325))
- Fortunately, there are times when we manage to unhook ourselves from difficult thoughts and feelings — and do towards moves instead. And the greater our ability to do this, the better life gets: ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=333))
- ‘values’: your heart’s deepest desires for how you want to behave as a human being; ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=336))
- how you generally tend to treat them, and what you say and do when they’re distressed or struggling ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=343))
- how you generally tend to treat other people. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=344))
- what your three greatest qualities are, in terms of how you interact with others. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=345))
- our minds have evolved over 300,000 years to think the way they do, so it’s unlikely a few positive thoughts will make much difference! ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=491))
- even if you can make them go away temporarily, after a while they’re back. And then they go away again. And then they come back again. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=495))
- given it so obviously contradicts our direct experience, how did this myth get established in the first place? ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=503))
- amazing ability to control our external environment gives us high expectations of control in other arenas ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=509))
- in the material world, control strategies generally work well. If we don’t like something, we figure out how to avoid it or get rid of it, and then we do so. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=510))
- As we grow up, many of us are taught to bottle up painful feelings and hide them from others; ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=574))
- As a result, most of us are reluctant to tell our friends and family when we are feeling sad or anxious ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=575))
- when you do things because they are truly meaningful to you ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=837))
- We would call them ‘values-guided actions’ ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=838))
- pretend the book you’re holding comprises all those difficult thoughts, images, memories, feelings, emotions, sensations and urges that you usually tend to struggle with. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=884))
- There are two main ways we respond to emotional storms: OBEY or STRUGGLE. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=960))
- And often we both OBEY and STRUGGLE simultaneously. In other words, we get ‘completely hooked’, which makes it almost impossible to effectively deal with whatever problem or difficulty set off the storm. ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=962))
- You’d want to drop anchor in that harbour both quickly and securely — because if you don’t, the storm will sweep your boat out to sea. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=965))
- When we notice and name our difficult thoughts and feelings, it reduces their effect on our behaviour. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=972))
- if I say, ‘I’m angry’, it seems as if I am that feeling; but when I say, ‘I’m noticing anger’, or ‘Here’s a feeling of anger’, it helps me to ‘step back’ a little, see it as an emotion passing through me. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=986))
- The aim is to keep acknowledging your thoughts and feelings and at the same time tune into and actively move your body. The reason for this is to give you more control over your physical actions ([Location 1050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=1050))
- When dropping anchor, we do the very opposite: we actively notice ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=1110))
- If we attempt to distract ourselves — try to get away from these unwanted inner experiences, ignore them, pretend they aren’t there — this is simply another form of struggling with them. ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=1111))
- if you are doing a task or activity that’s a towards move, then you keep doing it. And as you do it, you give it your full attention. ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=1142))
- when you’re feeling sluggish, drained, lethargic or like you ‘can’t be bothered doing anything’ — to help you wake up, energise and regain control of your actions. ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=1164))
- version while you’re stopped at a red light; or a one-minute version, first thing when you get out of bed; a two-minute version while waiting in a slow-moving line; ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=1167))
- So by all means, have your beliefs — but hold them lightly. Keep in mind that all beliefs are thoughts (i.e. words inside your head) whether or not they’re ‘true’. ([Location 1593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=1593))
- Find a thought that often hooks you. Put it into a short sentence (less than ten words) and for about ten seconds see if you can really let it hook you. Buy into it. Get caught up in it. Get as hooked as possible. ([Location 1654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=1654))
- If the ‘thinking self’ is broadcasting something unhelpful, we treat it like music playing in the background, and focus our attention on whatever we are doing here and now. ([Location 1954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=1954))
- Suppose you’re in a social situation and your mind is saying, ‘I’m so boring! I have nothing to say. I wish I could go home!’ It’s hard to have a good conversation if you’re focusing on those thoughts. ([Location 1964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=1964))
- Well, the more preoccupied we are with what is out of our control (such as things we can’t have), the more miserable and disempowered we become. ([Location 2119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=2119))
- our values connect us with what is in our control: the ability to act like the sort of person we want to be. ([Location 2120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=2120))
- The better we know our values, the easier it is to act on them; and the more we act on our values, the more we can shape our life in meaningful ways. ([Location 2128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=2128))
- A ‘reality gap’ is any painful gap between the reality you want and the reality you’ve got. And the bigger that gap, the greater the pain that goes with it. ([Location 2138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=2138))
- Accepting: open to, allowing of, or at peace with myself, others, life, my feelings, etc. ([Location 2160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=2160))

- Courageous: being brave or bold; persisting in the face of fear, threat or risk ([Location 2169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=2169))
- Curious: being open-minded and interested; willing to explore and discover ([Location 2172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098TK7QYM&location=2172))
