## Highlights
- creating a couple of core content pieces—for example, a white paper with new research or a deck employees can present in multiple contexts, and finding different ways to “slice and dice” it into blogs, social content, or emails. This enables you to give the content more “legs” and have more mini targeted moments to promote to your customer base.

- Tier 1 is the biggest launch you’ll have in a quarter; Tier 2 launches are generally important to the sales teams and your core customers but not “game changing”; and Tier 3 launches are cosmetic updates or bug fixes, and you might have dozens of these a quarter.

- You usually wouldn’t talk about a product publicly until it is at least in the beta phase. Until that point, you are testing if that product will even work and if it has “product/market” fit, or if it will be successful with your intended target market.

- You need to understand your potential customer before you bring a product to market, as this is a major part of your GTM strategy. This will help you dictate who to target, how to target them (which channels), and even what you say (the messaging).
