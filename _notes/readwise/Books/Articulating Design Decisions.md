## Highlights
- No passion in the world is equal to the passion to alter someone else’s draft. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015X0WFCW&location=596))
- FOCUS ON THE PRODUCT, NOT THE PROCESS ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015X0WFCW&location=717))
- we can get bogged down in the details of execution and less focused on what we’re trying to achieve. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015X0WFCW&location=720))
- what makes a good design good? ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015X0WFCW&location=726))
- our job is to find a solution and measure its success. ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015X0WFCW&location=744))
- what sets us apart from nondesigners is our ability to intuitively solve problems. The hard part, though, is figuring out what drives that intuition. ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015X0WFCW&location=757))
- The best way I know to practice being conscious of your decisions is to write them down. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015X0WFCW&location=767))
- Implicit in this question is that we know what the alternatives are, we’ve considered them or even tried them, and we’re prepared to explain why our solution is better. ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015X0WFCW&location=877))
- Create a bunch of alternative designs, don’t throw them away, and have them available if you need them. ([Location 893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015X0WFCW&location=893))
- When other people realize that you’ve put thought into it and are being intentional, they’re more willing to trust you, even if they disagree. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015X0WFCW&location=908))
