## Highlights
- an outcome is a change in human behavior that drives business results. ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=49))
- The Problem with Features ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=59))
- It’s common to get caught in this kind of confusion—mistaking “making stuff” for making progress, and mistaking shipping features for being done. ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=59))
- but in order to deliver value early and often you have to have clarity about what “value” means. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=113))
- knew we should be delivering value sooner than we planned to—but we didn’t know how to step back and think critically about our work. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=116))
- When you start thinking critically about value delivery instead of features, you very quickly run into a problem: how can we be sure that the stuff we’re making is actually going to deliver value? ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=127))
- A day or two of planning would have yielded many ideas, and many of them could have been tested in low-risk, safe-to-fail ways. And even a few small failures would have been better than the one giant two-year failure we experienced. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=137))
- it simply means “an experiment.” An MVP is NOT version 1.0 of your product. Instead, think of MVP as the the smallest thing you can do or the smallest thing you can make to learn if your hypothesis is correct. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=147))
- plan work in this way—as a combination of outcome goals and experiments, ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=151))
- manage with outcomes: ask teams to create a specific customer behavior that drives business results. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=156))
- using outcomes to direct the work of your teams unlocks your team’s creativity. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=159))
- we just need to understand what our customers are doing that drives the results that we care about. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=194))
- Behind this question lie a set of related and incredibly important questions: What are our customers trying to do? How do they do that today? How can we make it easier for them to do that? ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=243))
- This question opens up our solution space to a much broader range of possibilities. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=250))
- “what (user/customer/employee) behaviors has this initiative created that are driving business results?” ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=279))
- The whole point of OKR is to help you think critically about what you’re working on, not simply find a new way to talk about it. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=300))
- given the uncertainty, it’s irresponsible to promise certainty (in the form of certain features and certain dates.) ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=353))
- planning a roadmap around a customer journey. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=360))
- two critical outcomes of the work: the outcome they are seeking for the customer or user, and the outcome they are seeking for the business. These two outcomes must be linked. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=467))
- “A lot of it was about focusing more on wireframes and lo-fi design, both with users [during pre-release testing] and with developers. So we’re making fewer assumptions and focusing more on early engagement between devs and designers.” ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=486))
- we stop working on something when we’ve made enough progress to feel satisfied. This means we have to define what result will satisfy us. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=499))
- They threw away their backlog of work. The whole thing. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=518))
- We didn’t lose anything except the false hope that it would get done.” ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=521))
- feature-based way of planning work had made it hard to prioritize work. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=523))
- The idea was to understand and agree on the top three outcomes executives wanted to get to in the next quarter. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=530))
- “the ticket submission template asked for the problem, the hypotheses, baseline data, and what they hoped to achieve.” ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=535))
- simply asking stakeholders to think about outcomes, while a step in the right direction, wasn’t effective. ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=537))
- “People weren’t used to thinking that way for the whole business.” ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=540))
- It’s hard for everyone to shift their thinking from the concrete world of features to the abstract world of outcomes. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=541))
- I asked them to talk about what they were worried about. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=543))
- the team increased the frequency of stakeholder check-ins, going from meeting every two weeks to having regular mid-point check-ins and being conscientious to create lots of informal check-points as well. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=569))
- how can we change employee behavior in a way that generates business results?—that you use when setting goals for products. Outcomes-based thinking is, in fact, the key to transformation. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=602))
- When you are trying to transform an organization, you are trying to change the way the organization works—in other words, you’re trying to get your co-workers to change their behavior. ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=640))
