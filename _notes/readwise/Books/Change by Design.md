## Highlights
- I was trained as an industrial designer, but it took me a long time to realize the difference between being a designer and thinking like a designer. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=97))
- The risk of such an iterative approach is that it appears to extend the time it takes to get an idea to market, but this is often a shortsighted perception. To the contrary, a team that understands what is happening will not feel bound to take the next logical step along an ultimately unproductive path. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=221))
- As we say at IDEO, “Fail early to succeed sooner.” ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=226))
- In any case, predictability leads to boredom and boredom leads to the loss of talented people. It also leads to results that rivals find easy to copy. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=229))
- It is better to take an experimental approach: share processes, encourage the collective ownership of ideas, and enable teams to learn from one another. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=230))
- the mark of a designer, as the legendary Charles Eames said often, is a willing embrace of constraints. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=232))
- Without constraints design cannot happen, and the best design—a precision medical device or emergency shelter for disaster victims—is often carried out within quite severe constraints. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=233))
- Constraints can best be visualized in terms of three overlapping criteria for successful ideas: feasibility (what is functionally possible within the foreseeable future); viability (what is likely to become part of a sustainable business model); and desirability (what makes sense to people and for people). ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=240))
- most companies tend to approach new ideas quite differently. Quite reasonably, they are likely to start with the constraint of what will fit within the framework of the existing business model. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=254))
- teams of researchers will discover a new way of doing something and only afterward will they think about how the technology might fit into an existing business system and create value. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=259))
- Relatively few technical innovations bring an immediate economic benefit that will justify the investments of time and resources they require. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=261))
- Today, corporations instead attempt to narrow their innovation efforts to ideas that have more near-term business potential. They may be making a big mistake. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=263))
- a design project is not open-ended and ongoing. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and it is precisely these restrictions that anchor it to the real world. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=275))
- design thinking is expressed within the context of a project forces us to articulate a clear goal at the outset. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=276))
- the brief is a set of mental constraints that gives the project team a framework from which to begin, benchmarks by which they can measure progress, and a set of objectives to be realized: ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=289))
- the project brief is not a set of instructions or an attempt to answer a question before it has been posed. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=291))
- A design brief that is too abstract risks leaving the project team wandering about in a fog. One that starts from too narrow a set of constraints, however, almost guarantees that the outcome will be incremental and, most likely, mediocre. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=305))
- There is a popular saying around IDEO that “all of us are smarter than any of us,” ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=341))
- Design thinkers, by contrast, cross the “T.” They may be architects who have studied psychology, artists with MBAs, or engineers with marketing experience. A creative organization is constantly on the lookout for people with the capacity and—just as important—the disposition for collaboration across disciplines. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=351))
- In a multidisciplinary team each individual becomes an advocate for his or her own technical specialty and the project becomes a protracted negotiation ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=355))
- In an interdisciplinary team there is collective ownership of ideas and everybody takes responsibility for them. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=356))
- we have learned that we must channel this energy productively, and one way to achieve this is to do away with one large team in favor of many small ones. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=362))
- the inspiration phase, by contrast, requires a small, focused group whose job is to establish the overall framework. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=364))
- Look at the credits on your next movie rental, and check out the preproduction phase. There will invariably be a small team consisting of director, writer, producer, and production designer who have developed the basic concept. Only later do the “armies” arrive. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=367))
- our goal should be to create interdependent networks of small teams ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=375))
- good ideas rarely come on schedule and may wither and die in the interludes between weekly meetings. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=398))
- What is a prerequisite is an environment—social but also spatial—in which people know they can experiment, take risks, and explore the full range of their faculties. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=408))
- A culture that believes that it is better to ask forgiveness afterward rather than permission before, that rewards people for success but gives them permission to fail, has removed one of the main obstacles to the formation of new ideas. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=412))
- The simultaneous visibility of these project materials helps us identify patterns and encourages creative synthesis to occur much more readily than when these resources are hidden away in file folders, notebooks, or PowerPoint decks. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=453))
- focus upon three mutually reinforcing elements of any successful design program. I’ll call them insight, observation, and empathy. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=509))
- go out into the world and observe the actual experiences of commuters, skateboarders, and registered nurses as they improvise their way through their daily lives. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=513))
- almost every project we undertake involves an intensive period of observation. We watch what people do (and do not do) and listen to what they say (and do not say). This takes some practice. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=546))
- As any anthropologist will attest, observation relies on quality, not quantity. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=549))
- By concentrating solely on the bulge at the center of the bell curve, however, we are more likely to confirm what we already know ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=552))
- For insights at that level we need to head for the edges, the places where we expect to find “extreme” users who live differently, think differently, and consume differently— ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=554))
- If we are to “borrow” the lives of other people to inspire new ideas, we need to begin by recognizing that their seemingly inexplicable behaviors represent different strategies for coping with the confusing, complex, and contradictory world in which they live. ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=620))
- a design team should expect to move through three overlapping spaces over the course of a project: an inspiration space, in which insights are gathered from every possible source; an ideation space, in which those insights are translated into ideas; and an implementation space, in which the best ideas are developed into a concrete, fully conceived plan of action. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002PEP4EG&location=804))
