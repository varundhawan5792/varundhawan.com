## Highlights
- The idea is that by keeping holy vibrations there the place becomes and remains illumined. Those who cannot afford to have a room set apart can practise anywhere they like. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=394))
- REQUISITES FOR MEDITATION ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=396))
- Do not practise when the body feels very lazy or ill, or when the mind is very miserable and sorrowful. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=399))
- pray for knowledge and light; every other prayer is selfish. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=417))
- Sit for some time and let the mind run on. You simply wait and watch. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=420))
- Give up all argumentation and other distractions. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=423))
- It only throws the mind off its balance and disturbs it. Things of subtler planes have to be realised. Will talking do that? So give up all vain talk. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=424))
- Think of your own body, and see that it is strong and healthy; ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=427))
- Freedom is never to be reached by the weak. Throw away all weakness. Tell your body that it is strong, tell your mind that it is strong, and have unbounded faith and hope in yourself. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=429))
- A FEW EXAMPLES OF MEDITATION ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=431))
- Therefore do not hate anybody, because that hatred which comes out from you, must, in the long run, come back to you. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=450))
- If you love, that love will come back to you, completing the circle. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=450))
- BE CHEERFUL! ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=464))
- If you have a clouded face, do not go out that day, shut yourself up in your room. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=468))
- “He who hates none, who is the friend of all, who is merciful to all, who has nothing of his own, who is free from egoism, who is even-minded in pain and pleasure, who is forbearing, who is always satisfied, who works always in Yoga, whose self has become controlled, whose will is firm, ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=471))
- He who does not depend on anything, who is pure and active, who does not care whether good comes or evil, and never becomes miserable, who has given up all efforts for himself; ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=475))
- PATIENCE ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=485))
- He was ready to work through all those births, nothing discouraged him. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=500))
- THREE STAGES OF MEDITATION ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=539))
- When you come out of it after the hour, you have had the most beautiful rest you ever had in your life. That is the only way you ever give rest to your system. Not even the deepest sleep will give you such rest as that. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=549))
- There is no inspiration. Whatever passes for inspiration is the result that comes from causes already in the mind. One day, flash comes the result! Their past work was the cause. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=565))
- How can Vedanta be realised? Swamiji: By “hearing, reflection, and meditation.” Hearing must take place from a Sad-Guru ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=642))
- We should try to meditate inside. As for the mind being here or there, it will take a long time before we reach the mental plane. Now our struggle is with the body. When one acquires a perfect steadiness in posture, then and then alone one begins to struggle with the mind. Asana [posture] being conquered, one’s limbs remain motionless, and one can sit as long as one pleases. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=647))
- HOW TO BE DETACHED Almost all our suffering is caused by our not having the power of detachment. So along with the development of concentration we must develop the power of detachment. We must learn not only to attach the mind to one thing exclusively, but also to detach it at a moment’s notice and place it upon something else. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=678))
- Our minds are forced to become fixed upon different things by an attraction in them which we cannot resist. To control the mind, to place it just where we want it, requires special training. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=686))
- The mind uncontrolled and unguided will drag us down, down, for ever — rend us, kill us; and the mind controlled and guided will save us, free us. ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=689))
- To control the mind you must go deep down into the subconscious mind, classify and arrange in order all the different impressions, thoughts, etc., stored up there, and control them. This is the first step. By the control of the subconscious mind you get control over the conscious. ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=697))
- A Yogi must avoid the two extremes of luxury and austerity. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=777))
- He who fasts, he who keeps awake, he who sleeps much, he who works too much, he who does no work, none of these can be a Yogi. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=778))
- IN THE HOURS OF MEDITATION ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=793))
- the mind is at first apt to wander. But let any desire whatever arise in the mind, you must sit calmly and watch what sort of ideas are coming. By continuing to watch in that way, the mind becomes calm, ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=796))
- Those things that you have previously thought deeply, have transformed themselves into a subconscious current, and therefore these come up in the mind in meditation. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=797))
- Meditate every day alone. Everything will open up of itself. During meditation, suppress the emotional side altogether. That is a great source of danger. ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=806))
- READ YOUR OWN LIFE ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=817))
- You are the greatest book that ever was or ever will be, the infinite depository of all that is. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=822))
- EIGHT LIMBS OF YOGA ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=829))
- Ignorance, fickleness, jealousy, laziness, and excessive attachment are the great enemies to success in Yoga practice. ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=856))
- Keep your thoughts on virtue; what we think we tend to become. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=936))
- Be grateful to him who curses you, for he gives you a mirror to show what cursing is, also a chance to practise self-restraint; ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=971))
- Do not be miserable! Do not repent! What is done is done. If you burn yourself, take the consequences. ([Location 1032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1032))
- Be sensible. We make mistakes; what of that? That is all in fun. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1034))
- Do not repent! After having done work, do not think of it. Go on! Stop not! Don’t look back! What will you gain by looking back? ([Location 1035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1035))
- He who knows that he is free is free; he who knows that he is bound is bound. What is the end and aim of life? None, because I know that I am the Infinite. If you are beggars, you can have aims. I have no aims, no want, no purpose. I come to your country, and lecture — just for fun. ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1036))
- LET BYGONES BE BYGONES ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1055))
- What good will it do you to think all your lives, “Oh, I have done evil, I have made many mistakes?” It requires no ghost to tell us that. Bring in the light and the evil goes in a moment. Build up your character, and manifest your real nature, the Effulgent, the Resplendent, the Ever-Pure, and call It up in everyone that you see. ([Location 1059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1059))
- NO ONE TO BLAME ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1076))
- “This misery that I am suffering is of my own doing, and that very thing proves that it will have to be undone by me alone.” ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1078))
- Therefore, stand up, be bold, be strong. Take the whole responsibility on your own shoulders, and know that you are the creator of your own destiny. ([Location 1080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1080))
- the conquest of evil comes by the change in the subjective alone. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1095))
- The cause of all miseries from which we suffer is desire. You desire something, and the desire is not fulfilled; and the result is distress. ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1135))
- I, as I am now, am the resultant of all I have done, all I have thought. Every action and thought have had their effect, and these effects are the sum total of my progress. ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1141))
- The solution is this: Not that you should not have property, not that you should not have things which are necessary and things which are even luxuries. Have all that you want, and more, only know the truth and realise it. Wealth does not belong to anybody. Have no idea of proprietorship, possessorship. ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1143))
- And the only religion that ought to be taught is the religion of fearlessness. It is fear that brings misery, fear that brings death, fear that breeds evil. And what causes fear? Ignorance of our own nature. ([Location 1246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1246))
- WHAT WE THINK WE BECOME ([Location 1283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005V2V6GY&location=1283))
