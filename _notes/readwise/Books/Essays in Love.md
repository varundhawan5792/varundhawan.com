## Highlights
- We fall in love hoping we won’t find in another what we know is in ourselves, all the cowardice, weakness, laziness, dishonesty, compromise, and stupidity. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=240))
- They believe in it, but pretend they don’t until they’re allowed to. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=333))
- the first rule of flirtation, where what is said is never what is meant? ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=338))
- We charm by coincidence rather than design. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=441))
- To think during sex is to violate a fundamental law of intercourse. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=463))
- If one is not wholly convinced of one’s own lovability, receiving affection can appear like being bestowed an honour for a feat one feels no connection with. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=551))
- We would not love if there were no lack within us, but we are offended by the discovery of a similar lack in the other. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=609))
- If self-hatred gains the upper hand, then the one who has received love will declare that the beloved (on some excuse or other) is not good enough for them (not good enough by virtue of associating with no-goods). But if self-love gains the upper hand, both partners may accept that seeing their love reciprocated is not proof of how low the beloved is, but of how lovable they have themselves turned out to be. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=624))
- it is easier to impute similarity than investigate difference. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=644))
- We should reserve our leap until we have completed a clear-eyed investigation of the depths and nature of the waters. Only after we have undertaken a thorough exchange of opinions on parenting, politics, art, science, and appropriate snacks for the kitchen should two people ever decide they are ready to love each other. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=647))
- Perhaps the easiest people to fall in love with are those about whom we know nothing. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=678))
- What is an experience? Something that breaks a polite routine and for a brief period allows us to witness things with the heightened sensitivity afforded to us by novelty, danger, or beauty – and it’s on the basis of shared experiences that intimacy is given an opportunity to grow. ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=1166))
- ‘A man can acquire anything in solitude except a character,’ ([Location 1213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M44000U&location=1213))
