## Highlights
- When we can look at ourselves and at others as beautiful, unique flowers and trees we can truly grow to understand and love one another. One flower may bloom early in the spring and another flower may bloom in late summer. One tree may bear many fruits and another tree may offer cool shade. No one plant is greater or lesser or the same as any other plant in the garden. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=968))
- We can cultivate our solidity and freedom—solid in our deepest aspiration and free from our fears, misunderstandings, and suffering. ([Location 984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=984))
- You can relax into the collective wisdom and insights of the Sangha and see clearly ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=990))
- When communication is cut off, we all suffer. ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=1164))
- We have lost our capacity to say things calmly. We get irritated too easily. ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=1171))
- You listen without giving advice or passing judgment. You can say to yourself about the other person, “I am listening to him just because I want to relieve his suffering.” This is called compassionate listening. ([Location 1178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=1178))
- You suffer not because things are impermanent. You suffer because things are impermanent and you don’t know that they are impermanent. This is very important. ([Location 1236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=1236))
- Silence means that we’re not disturbed inside; there’s no talking inside. ([Location 1372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=1372))
- A Lazy Day is a day for us to be without any scheduled activities. We just let the day unfold naturally, timelessly. ([Location 1391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=1391))
- The Lazy Day has been prescribed for us to train ourselves not to be afraid of doing nothing. ([Location 1399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=1399))
- It is only when we get bored and become aware that we are seeking entertainment to hide the feelings of loneliness and worthlessness in ourselves that the tension, the depression, the stress begin to dissolve. ([Location 1400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=1400))
- On Lazy Days, you do your best to refrain from doing something. Try to do nothing. ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008GTXVZ8&location=1408))
