## Highlights
- Most work is not coming up with The Next Big Thing. Rather, it’s making better the thing you already thought of six months—or six years—ago. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CZ7OC46&location=305))
- Because either it means giving up on the last great idea (the one that still requires follow-up) or it means further stuffing the backlog of great ideas. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CZ7OC46&location=307))
- First, few such rays actually warrant the label “brilliant”—more likely they’re mere rays of enthusiasm (and not to be confused with a priority). ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CZ7OC46&location=312))
- Second, you’d be amazed how much quality collective thought can be captured using two simple tools: a voice connection and a shared screen. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CZ7OC46&location=313))
