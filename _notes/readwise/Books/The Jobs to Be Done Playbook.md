- “People don’t want a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole.” ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X1LQ45Y&location=289))

- A rule of thumb is to focus on the “what” main job—a functional objective—more than the “why” in terms of aspiration. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X1LQ45Y&location=853))
- Reflect on a few simple questions to get started: ([Location 859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X1LQ45Y&location=859))
- Use a combination to probe on the job, the process, and their needs and emotions. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X1LQ45Y&location=1063))
