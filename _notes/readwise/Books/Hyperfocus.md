## Highlights
- Maintaining a distractions list as you read will capture the important things that float to the surface of your consciousness. Writing them down to make sure they don’t slip through the cracks will let you refocus on the task at hand. ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=125))
- When I finish that first read, I go through the book a second time, rereading just the highlighted parts so I can really process the most valuable nuggets. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=142))
- step back from this book for a few minutes to do something relatively mindless. Whether it’s washing the dishes, people watching, or cleaning the house, you’ll effectively recharge your attention. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=151))
- We typically manage our attention on autopilot. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=171))
- When we’re talking with a coworker or a loved one, we automatically focus on forming clever responses in our head before she finishes her thought. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=173))
- roughly how much of your time do you spend deliberately and with intention, deciding in advance what you want to do and when you’ll do it? ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=176))
- “Attentional space” is the term I use to describe the amount of mental capacity we have available to focus on and process things in the moment. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=310))
- If your brain were a computer, your attentional space would be its RAM. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=315))
- thinking, feeling, and perceiving at any given moment. Mindfulness adds another important dimension to the mix: not judging what you’re thinking about. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=356))
- Many experts argue that we can’t multitask, which is often true for tasks that require focus to do properly ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=375))
- we’re able to multitask surprisingly well with habits. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=377))
- I like to lump my personal, relatively rote “maintenance tasks” together ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=381))
- while listening to podcasts or an audiobook. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=382))
- If we tried carrying on a conversation with our significant other out of habit, we’d probably not process or remember it and find ourselves falling back on statements like “Yes, dear.” ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=402))
- there are generally three combinations of tasks that fit comfortably within your attentional space. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=420))
- Having some attentional space to spare during complex tasks allows you to do two things: It leaves room to reflect on the best approach to completing the task, so you can work smarter and avoid autopilot mode. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=434))
- Leaving some space also enables you to work with a greater awareness of where you should be directing your attention in the first place. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=437))
- Fitting the right amount and type of tasks into attentional space is both an art and an investment in productivity. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=440))
- On the drive home, shut off the radio, which will enable you to process the day and also remember your intention to pick up bread. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=471))
- When your attentional space is overwhelmed, you, in turn, feel overwhelmed. When your attentional space is clear, you also feel clear. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=475))
- the brain’s prefrontal cortex—the large part of the forebrain that lets us plan, think logically, and get work done—has a built-in “novelty bias.” Whenever we switch between tasks, it rewards us with dopamine ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=482))
- Productivity is not about cramming more into our days but about doing the right thing in each moment. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=505))
- I’ve noticed that as I’ve allowed more devices into my life, I remember less in general. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=514))
- “When we learn while we multitask, we rely more heavily on the basal ganglia, a brain system that’s involved in the learning of skills and habits.” However, “when we encode information in a more focused state, we rely more heavily on our brain’s hippocampus—which actually lets us store and recall the information.” ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=519))
- on average, we work for just forty seconds before we’re either interrupted or distracted (or in other words, interrupt ourselves). ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=532))
- Switching becomes easier only once we finish a task—especially when time pressure, like a deadline, motivates us to get the task done. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=551))
- “if you work on something and you don’t really have to rush, but you get it done, your brain can keep thinking about ‘What else should I have done?’ ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=552))
- Time pressure narrows our focus on the task, restricting us from considering a number of more creative ways to complete it. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=556))
- Switching does make your work more stimulating, and its costs may be worth bearing if your work takes only 5 percent longer and you make only the occasional mistake. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=559))
- when we continually switch between tasks, our work takes 50 percent longer, compared with doing one task from start to completion. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=560))
- best time to take a break is after you’ve finished a big task. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=563))
- In order to put its advice into practice, you’ll need to do several things: set intentions more often, modify your environment to be less distracting, overcome the mental resistance you have to certain tasks, eliminate distractions before they derail you, ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=568))
- and clear the distractions inside your own head. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=570))
- Hyperfocus is many things at once: it’s deliberate, undistracted, and quick to refocus, and it leads us to become completely immersed in our work. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=608))
- only one productive or meaningful task consumes your attentional space. This is simply nonnegotiable. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=622))
- because you’re focusing on a single task, you likely have some attentional space to spare—enough that you are also able to keep your original intention in mind. ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=639))
- preventing yourself from focusing on things that aren’t important. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BDJ99VR&location=644))
