## Highlights
- processed foods and sugar are inherently bad for us, even if we don’t eat them in caloric excess. ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=107))
- although what we eat matters, how we eat it – in which order, combination, and grouping – matters too. ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=120))
- Dysregulated glucose levels contribute to aging and to the development of chronic conditions such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, arthritis, cataracts, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, depression, gut problems, heart disease, infertility, PCOS, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver disease. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=139))
- too much fructose increases the likelihood of obesity, heart disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=147))
- For instance, your genes can increase your likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, but they can’t tell you for sure whether you’ll get it. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=221))
- The ‘diets’ that work are the ones that flatten our glucose, fructose and insulin curves. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=343))
- Early studies showed that the thriving range for fasting glucose may be between 4 and 4.7 mmol/L. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=616))
- we should strive to avoid increasing our glucose levels by more than 1.7 mmol/L after eating. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=622))
- I will define a glucose spike as an increase in glucose in our body of more than 1.7 mmol/L after eating. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=623))
- remember that if the food you ate was sweet and it created a glucose spike, it also created an invisible fructose spike, and that’s what makes a sweet spike more harmful than a starchy spike. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=649))
- Free radicals are a big deal because anything they touch, they damage. They randomly snap and modify our genetic code (our DNA), creating mutations that activate harmful genes and can lead to the development of cancer. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=687))
- When there are too many free radicals to be neutralised, our body is said to be in a state of oxidative stress. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=691))
- fructose increases oxidative stress even more than glucose alone. That’s one of the reasons that sweet foods ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=693))
- The combination of too many free radicals, oxidative stress and glycation leads to a generalised state of inflammation in the body. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=719))
- The good news is, a diet that reduces glucose spikes decreases inflammation and along with it your risk of contracting any of these inflammation-based diseases. ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=726))
- Flattening our glucose curve leads to fewer cravings. ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=831))
- If you want a good night’s sleep, flatten your curves. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=845))
- people with elevated glucose levels have been shown to be more easily infected, ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=850))
- Children born today have a one in two chance of developing cancer in their lifetime. And poor diet, together with smoking, is the main driver in 50 per cent of cancers. ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=919))
- What’s more, we’re discovering that gut health is linked to mental health – unhealthy microbiomes can contribute to mood disorders. The gut and the brain are connected by 500 million neurons ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=938))
- statins lower LDL pattern A, but they don’t lower the problematic pattern B. This is why statins don’t decrease the risk of a first heart attack. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=957))
- The group who ate their food in the right order saw a significant reduction in their HbA1c level, which means they started reversing their type 2 diabetes. ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=1056))
- if you compare two diets, the one with more carbohydrates leads to less available circulating energy post-digestion. ([Location 1534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=1534))
- Start your smoothie with protein powder, then add a combination of linseed or flaxseed oil, coconut oil, avocado, seeds, nuts and a cup of spinach. Finally, add some sugar for taste: ideally berries, ([Location 1693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=1693))
- The best options to keep your glucose levels steady are berries, citrus fruits and small, tart apples, because they contain the most fibre and smallest amount of sugar. ([Location 1710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=1710))
- Resistance exercise (weight-lifting) has been shown to decrease the glucose spike by up to 30 per cent and the size of further spikes over the following 24 hours by 35 per cent. ([Location 2135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=2135))
- A good rule of thumb to distinguish between them: cook with fats that are solid at room temperature when you can. ([Location 2379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=2379))
- if you think you’re about to eat something sugary, that can cause the food to cause a bigger spike for you than someone else. ([Location 2572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MFGK6K2&location=2572))
