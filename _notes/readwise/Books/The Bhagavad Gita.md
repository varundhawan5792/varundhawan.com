## Highlights
- the Upanishads agree on their central ideas: Brahman, the Godhead; Atman, the divine core of personality; dharma, the law that expresses and maintains the unity of creation; karma, the web of cause and effect; samsara, the cycle of birth and death; moksha, the spiritual liberation that is life’s supreme goal.

- It is difficult to remove such a tree, and terribly difficult to undo the effects of a lifetime of negative thinking, which can extend into many other people’s lives. But it can be done, and the purpose of the Gita is to show how. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DI7R5G&location=330))
- the ego dies every night. Every morning we pick up our desires where we left off: the same person, yet a little different too. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DI7R5G&location=347))
- For practical purposes – at least as far as the Gita is concerned – Purusha may be regarded as a synonym for Atman. Purusha is the Self, beyond all change, the same in every creature. ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DI7R5G&location=372))
- Kindness to others, to take just one example, favors a nervous system that is kind to itself. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DI7R5G&location=434))
- the gunas are essentially born of the mind. When the mind’s activity is stilled, we see life as it is. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DI7R5G&location=450))
- the eighteen chapters of the Gita are said to break into three six-chapter parts. The first third, according to this, deals with karma yoga, the second with jnana yoga, and the last with bhakti yoga: that is, the Gita begins with the way of selfless action, passes into the way of Self-knowledge, and ends with the way of love. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DI7R5G&location=500))
- Desire is the fuel of life; without desire nothing can be achieved, let alone so stupendous a feat as Self-realization. Kama is not desire; it is selfish desire. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DI7R5G&location=535))
- The Gita teaches simply that this selfish craving is what makes a person feel separate from the rest of life. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DI7R5G&location=538))
- Work hard in the world without any selfish attachment, the Gita counsels, and you will purify your consciousness of self-will. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DI7R5G&location=540))
