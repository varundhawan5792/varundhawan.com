## Highlights
- You’ll get closer to actionable takeaways by looking for broad patterns of success and failure. The more common the pattern, the more applicable it might be to your life. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=429))
- “Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.” ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=437))
- Failure can be a lousy teacher, because it seduces smart people into thinking their decisions were terrible when sometimes they just reflect the unforgiving realities of risk. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=441))
- It is not intuitive that an investor can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune. It means we underestimate how normal it is for a lot of things to fail. Which causes us to overreact when they do. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=825))
- An Oscar turned Walt from famous to full-blown celebrity. By 1938 he had produced several hundred hours of film. But in business terms, the 83 minutes of Snow White were all that mattered. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=833))
- More than half of all public technology and telecom companies lose most of their value and never recover. Even among public utilities the failure rate is more than 1 in 10: ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=855))
- Napoleon’s definition of a military genius was, “The man who can do the average thing when all those around him are going crazy.” It’s the same in investing. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=880))
- no one makes good decisions all the time. The most impressive people are packed full of horrendous ideas that are often acted upon. ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=914))
- Part of why this isn’t intuitive is because in most fields we only see the finished product, not the losses incurred that led to the tail-success product. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=926))
- “It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=945))
- Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered. More than your salary. More than the size of your house. More than the prestige of your job. Control over doing what you want, when you want to, with the people you want to, is the broadest lifestyle variable that makes people happy. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=964))
- doing something you love on a schedule you can’t control can feel the same as doing something you hate. There is a name for this feeling. Psychologists call it reactance. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=986))
- People like to feel like they’re in control—in the drivers’ seat. When we try to get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, they feel like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else, even when they might have originally been happy to go along. ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=989))
- More of us have jobs that look closer to Rockefeller than a typical 1950s manufacturing worker, which means our days don’t end when we clock out and leave the factory. We’re constantly working in our heads, which means it feels like work never ends. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1031))
- What they did value were things like quality friendships, being part of something bigger than themselves, and spending quality, unstructured time with their children. “Your kids don’t want your money (or what your money buys) anywhere near as much as they want you. Specifically, they want you with them,” ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1053))
- When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, “Wow, the guy driving that car is cool.” Instead, you think, “Wow, if I had that car people would think I’m cool.” ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1065))
- Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money. ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1085))
- The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising. Not that we should use past surprises as a guide to future boundaries; that we should use past surprises as an admission that we have no idea what might happen next. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1432))
- if something has 95% odds of being right, the 5% odds of being wrong means you will almost certainly experience the downside at some point in your life. And if the cost of the downside is ruin, the upside the other 95% of the time likely isn’t worth the risk, no matter how appealing it looks.

- Compounding works best when you can give a plan years or decades to grow. This is true for not only savings but careers and relationships. Endurance is key. And when you consider our tendency to change who we are over time, balance at every point in your life becomes a strategy to avoid future regret and encourage endurance.
