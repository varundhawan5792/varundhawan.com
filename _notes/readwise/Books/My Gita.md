## Highlights
- A world created by observation evokes insight, hence affection, for we see the hunger and fear of all beings. Life becomes a performance on a stage (ranga-bhoomi) aimed to nourish and comfort the other, while deriving nourishment and comfort from their delight. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=417))
- At a social level, the idea of rebirth expands the canvas of our lives and brings perspective. It reminds us that the world existed before us and the world will exist after us. ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=512))
- while changes do take place technologically, no real change takes place psychologically—people are still jealous and angry and ambitious and greedy and heartbroken. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=514))
- The world into which we are born is imagined as a stage full of actors but with no script, or director. Everyone assumes they are the hero, but discover they are not the protagonists of the ongoing play. We are forced to play certain roles and speak certain dialogues. But we revolt. We want our own script to be performed and our own dialogues to be heard. So we negotiate with fellow actors. Some succeed in getting heard with some people, others fail with most people, no one succeeds with everybody. We cling to our scripts, submit to other people’s scripts, speak dialogues we do not want to, only to stay relevant and connected to the larger narrative, or at least to a subplot. Heroes emerge. Villains emerge. Heroes of one plot turn out to be villains of other plots. Eventually, all leave the stage but the play continues. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=516))
- Taken psychologically, the idea of rebirth is about having multiple opportunities to break the cycle of fear and find meaning, without ‘consuming’ anyone. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=541))
- Hindu mythology constantly refers to this four-fold division of the world—the world of elements, plants, animals and humans. Symbolically, it is represented by the swastika. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=587))
- Plants, animals and humans constitute the living (sa-jiva). They depend on air (prana) and so are called breathers (prani). ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=595))
- Humans are dramatically different. In us, senses, emotions and intelligence are highly developed. But what really makes us unique is our imagination (manas). ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=604))
- Krishna experiences every slice (bhaga) of reality, that of elements, plants, animals as well as humans. That is why he is called God (bhaga-van) in The Gita. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=609))
- Concepts therefore help us rationalize emotions; emotions help us rationalize concepts—it is a two-way process. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=634))
- Even our identity (aham) is essentially how we imagine ourselves, a concept. Nature does not care for our tribal roots, our social structures or our cultural hierarchies. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=646))
- Without poetry, you cannot communicate ideas that are not material and measurable, like love, or justice or remarkability. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=686))
- ‘This is complete, that is complete, from completeness comes completeness, when completeness is added or subtracted, it still remains complete.’ This hymn refers to the concept of infinity and the capability of human imagination. You are complete in yourself; I am complete in myself; yet we are part of a wider human narrative. Like the seed of the tree, we are part of completeness, as well as our complete selves. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=750))
- The act of eating is violent, as elements and plants and animals are devoured by the hungry. Where there is life, there is hunger. Where there is hunger, there is food. Where there is food, there is violence. Where there is violence, there are consequences. Nature is violent, as the hungry seek food. This is the fundamental truth of life. ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=824))
- In human society, violence transforms: it is not just physical. It is also psychological, ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=830))
- Culture is created by domestication: the violent control of the earth and the violent control of the human mind. ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=831))
- Karma is both action and reaction. Each moment is a fruit (karma-phala) of the past and a seed (karma-bija) of the future. ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=846))
- Maybe we can imagine control over our actions, but we have no control over other people’s actions, hence the results. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=912))
- Arjuna, you have control over your action alone, not the fruits of your action. So do not be drawn to expectation, or inaction. ([Location 913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=913))
- To act is karma. Karma yoga is when we act without seeking control over the outcome. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=920))
- In Hinduism, dharma means realizing our potential: changing ourselves into the best we theoretically can be. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=939))
- When we do exercise our choice, when we value other people’s needs alongside our own, we are following dharma. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=955))
- better to do what you have been asked to do imperfectly than try to do perfectly what others have been asked to. All work has inadequacies; ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=993))
- Dharma thus has nothing to with rules or obligations. It has to do with intent and caring for the other, ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=1000))
- You may value me for what I have and what I do. But I am not what I have or what I do. If you love me, focus on who I am: my hungers and my fears, and my potential to focus on who you are. ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=2003))
- To let our potential be realized without deriving our identity from it, or without denying its existence, is the hallmark of wisdom. ([Location 2150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=2150))
- The wise want nothing but accept whatever comes their way, letting it pass when it is time to part ways. ([Location 2156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=2156))
- Ram, though, does not see Sita as his property, but as his responsibility. ([Location 2178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=2178))
- Yet I work, for if I don’t, others won’t, and I will be the cause of confusion and destruction of all that has been created.— ([Location 2335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=2335))
