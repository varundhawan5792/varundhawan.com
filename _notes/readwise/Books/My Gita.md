## Highlights
- Hindu mythology constantly refers to this four-fold division of the world—the world of elements, plants, animals and humans. Symbolically, it is represented by the swastika. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=587))
- Plants, animals and humans constitute the living (sa-jiva). They depend on air (prana) and so are called breathers (prani). ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=595))
- Humans are dramatically different. In us, senses, emotions and intelligence are highly developed. But what really makes us unique is our imagination (manas). ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=604))
- Concepts therefore help us rationalize emotions; emotions help us rationalize concepts—it is a two-way process. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=634))
- In Hinduism, dharma means realizing our potential: changing ourselves into the best we theoretically can be. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=939))
- When we do exercise our choice, when we value other people’s needs alongside our own, we are following dharma. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=955))
- better to do what you have been asked to do imperfectly than try to do perfectly what others have been asked to. All work has inadequacies; ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=993))
- Dharma thus has nothing to with rules or obligations. It has to do with intent and caring for the other, ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=1000))
- You may value me for what I have and what I do. But I am not what I have or what I do. If you love me, focus on who I am: my hungers and my fears, and my potential to focus on who you are. ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=2003))
- To let our potential be realized without deriving our identity from it, or without denying its existence, is the hallmark of wisdom. ([Location 2150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=2150))
- The wise want nothing but accept whatever comes their way, letting it pass when it is time to part ways. ([Location 2156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=2156))
- Ram, though, does not see Sita as his property, but as his responsibility. ([Location 2178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=2178))
- Yet I work, for if I don’t, others won’t, and I will be the cause of confusion and destruction of all that has been created.— ([Location 2335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0171TCXSO&location=2335))
