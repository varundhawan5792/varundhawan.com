## Highlights
- Ambition that doesn’t know itself comes out as anxiety. Envy comes out as bitterness; anger turns into rage; sadness evolves into depression. ([Location 56](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZPSG8Y&location=56))
- We might be in bed or on the sofa, alone with a notepad and pen. Key to the practice are three well-angled questions: –   What am I presently anxious about? –   What am I presently upset about? –   What am I presently excited about? ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZPSG8Y&location=77))
- How much can we admit to ourselves about who we are ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZPSG8Y&location=213))
- How much do we need to insist on our own normality and sanity? ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZPSG8Y&location=214))
- Can we admit mistakes? Can we admit to envy, sadness and confusion? ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B2ZPSG8Y&location=215))
