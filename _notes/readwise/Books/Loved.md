## Highlights
- Product marketing's purpose is to drive product adoption by shaping market perception through strategic marketing activities that meet business goals. ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=679))
- Product marketing brings strategic intent and product insight to all market-facing activities. It coordinates a winning plan across the entire go-to-market engine (marketing and sales) and provides the foundational work for everything those teams need to succeed. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=682))
- It starts with the foundation of product marketing, which comes down to just four fundamentals from which all important work flows. They are: Fundamental 1: Ambassador: Connect Customer and Market Insights Fundamental 2: Strategist: Direct Your Product's Go-to-Market Fundamental 3: Storyteller: Shape How the World Thinks About Your Product Fundamental 4: Evangelist: Enable Others to Tell the Story ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=695))
- There is no way for a product to stand out and win unless its entire go-to-market engine is carefully coordinated and it holds a clear market position. That's product marketing. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=720))
- The art of finding and reaching that customer on their journey with the right message at the right time so they are willing to consider a product is the job of marketing. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=727))
- Product marketers define what aspects of a product to promote, who to target, why target customers care, and which channels are most important. They are the bridge between the product organization and ensuring the actions from the go-to-market engine of marketing and sales result in business impact. ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=735))
- Everything a product marketer does must be grounded in customer and market insights, which is why it is the first fundamental. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=804))
- segmenting customers, knowing frustrations and problems that drive them to seek something new, ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=808))
- knowing what makes raving, loyal fans and the “watering holes” that create influence or amplify influencers. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=809))
- understanding which activities engage future customers as well as existing ones. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=810))
- It also requires deep product knowledge of what customers find useful. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=811))
- Product marketing brings: knowledge of the buyer's frame of mind, how the competitive landscape might affect a decision, and what that means for how a product should be positioned. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=812))
- Product marketing considers why a customer might want a product and how they are likely to find it, then plans accordingly. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=822))
- Positioning is the place a product occupies in people's minds. It sets a context in which a product's value becomes clear. The key messages supporting that positioning are what marketing and sales teams say and promote over and over to reinforce that position. A broader story narrative is what stiches it all together to make it stick. ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=838))
- Positioning is a long-term game, while messaging is a shorter-term one. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=840))
- For messaging, the range of work includes iterative development of messages that connect with the right audiences and helping people make more informed decisions. In the modern era, this means being genuinely helpful without being overly promotional or authoritative. It requires restraint and knowing what is most meaningful to audiences, ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=844))
- Our brains process stories differently than straight facts. It's why positioning and messaging is best done through stories— ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=847))
- Evangelism only works if it feels authentic. The range of work to make this happen includes providing direct sales teams with the right messages and tools to make them sound like genuine advocates, not just salespeople trying to sell. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=853))
- Evangelism also means finding the most meaningful influencers that move your market—key customers, analysts, pundits, press, bloggers, social influencers, online forums— ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=856))
- here are some baseline product marketing practices to stay connected with customer and market realities: Have direct customer interaction—ideally weekly. Develop a standard set of open-ended questions to ask customers or prospects. Reflect insights into product and go-to-market team discussions. Write the most important insights down so they can be easily shared and used. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=894))
- Product marketing should try to answer market-sensing questions and understand their implications across the entire buyer's journey, including both rational and emotional motivations: What are they trying to do? Do they recognize and prioritize this problem? What is motivating them to solve the problem? What compels them to take action? What in this product delivers the most value? Who is most likely to value and buy this product? What starts the journey toward acquiring the product? How might a product get discovered and become more desired over the entire journey? How might we reduce friction in acquiring the product? What do people need to see or hear to become customers? How can we delight customers so much that they want to talk about the product with others? ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=909))
- A market is shaped by more than what teams observe directly. It is influenced heavily by the ecosystem surrounding it. This requires developing a regular practice of gaining insight from third-party data, research, reports, articles, websites, reviews, press, and social media. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=926))
- If you're in a more mature company, you might be lucky enough to have a dedicated customer insights, customer research, or data analytics team. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=932))
- A product marketer's job is to intersect what is learned from direct customer feedback with what is learned from third parties and use it to inform internal conversations. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=934))
- Product marketing is the ambassador for all these customer and market insights, so they must be a part of the right internal conversations. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=960))
- They can accelerate a product feature or make sure an engineering blog gets written to diminish a competitor's approach. Product marketing directs appropriate response, whether it's through product, marketing, or sales. ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=961))
- Customer insights also often get translated into artifacts—like Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) stories (often used by product), Personas (often used by design or product), Ideal Customer Profile (ICP, often used by sales), and customer segmentations (often used by marketing). Each has a purpose that is specific to the function. ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=966))
- realities, the product marketer ensures the most important attributes that drive customer and market adoption are known and documented so teams can do their jobs better. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=972))
- the marketing strategies guiding Pocket on the whiteboard: grow a loyal user base, define and lead the category, and leverage partnerships for growth. Using them as guides to judge each idea, ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=988))
- At the level of an individual product, marketing strategies are driven by the product marketer to create alignment in a product go-to-market plan, where specific activities, how they get done, and dates come together. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1015))
- no marketing activities should happen before putting in place the why. This is done in a product go-to-market plan, in which marketing strategies tell us the why behind all market-facing activities. ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1051))
- Here are some starter questions to help think through your marketing strategies. Remember, their purpose is to guide all other marketing activities. Which tactics are most appropriate depends on your answers: Is third-party validation important for credibility? What kind of customers are you trying to acquire and how fast? Where do those customers spend time in their professional or personal lives? Are you trying to educate the space? What are the product's strengths? Are there particular trends that present opportunities in your category? Does someone else already have established relationships with the customers you're trying to reach? What is the preferred way to adopt new products or technology for your customers? ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1067))
- the strategy building blocks for a product's go-to-market inevitably fall into some variation of these themes: Enable growth to hit a revenue or business goal Improve conversion of specific customers Generate awareness, improve discovery, or build a brand Define, reshape, or lead a category, ecosystem, or platform Engender customer validation, loyalty, or evangelism Find and develop new customer segments, partners, and programs ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1078))
- Some worry taking the time to be strategic in a product's go-to-market slows things down or makes marketing less dynamic. Done well, it's an accelerant. ([Location 1084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1084))
- Don't make the mistake of assuming the world knows how to think about your product and why it's valuable. You must frame its value. ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1111))
- Positioning starts with knowing the story you want to tell about your product—and having the evidence to support it. ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1130))
- a good product can't succeed in the market without good messaging. It won't come from a formula; it comes from knowing what your audience needs to hear. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1161))
- CAST as a guide to check if your messaging is grounded in what customers want to hear. ([Location 1168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1168))
- if you have a direct sales force, they're product marketing's top priority to enable. But they can't be successful if others with enormous influence, such as analysts from research firms and editors in app stores or Tier 1 publications, aren't considered equally important. ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1251))
- Doing in-depth training of the field on the sales presentation and demo. ([Location 1258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1258))
- Partnering with product on the beta program so reference customers provided testimonials that informed direct mail messaging and ads. ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1259))
- I've seen many internal “sales decks” of internal advocates selling their leadership team on why expensive new software should be purchased—it's not always the rep doing that selling. ([Location 1268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1268))
- Communities are another common way to scale advocacy through others. It ranges from starting a group (like a Customer Council or Advisor Network), to participating in groups that already exist, ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1273))
- Effective evangelism isn't just about finding the best marketing channels; it's about reducing friction to access information that lets people effectively assess and advocate for your product. ([Location 1276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1276))
- Where should a sales rep look for the most up-do-date competitive responses? ([Location 1277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1277))
- Almost every team is good at cranking out content that talks about the product. What's often lacking is making it compelling, credible, or desirable for others to talk about. ([Location 1283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1283))
- Start instead with stories on what existing customers have recently done to use the product and solve a big challenge. This is not just because it's more believable, but also because whomever they're speaking with might learn something. Don't forget that people engage in discussions to learn, not to be lectured or sold to. ([Location 1289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1289))
- In organizations with growth teams, product marketing will focus on bridging product teams outside of the growth team, enabling positioning, defining product go-to-market, enabling important influencers, and intersecting marketing activities with sales or marketing functions. ([Location 1458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1458))
- The growth teams are more laser-focused on figuring out the mechanics, sequences, and combinations that lead to faster growth largely through the product and its data. ([Location 1460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1460))
- The product marketing work focuses on providing frameworks and guidance to marketing teams on how to appropriately engage customers throughout their life cycle, in all aspects of the funnel (awareness, acquisition, activation, revenue, retention, referral). ([Location 1467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1467))
- Modern customer journeys mean a lot of product assessment is done before a “customer” even puts up a hand showing interest. Revenue enablement means planting seeds along the buying journey. ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1480))
- Segmenting and enabling “customers” is also more complex in B2B. There is the “account” or company level, and within each account there is the buyer, the user, and many influencers. Influencers range from someone in the department using the product, to people in procurement who have no idea what the product does but are looking at what it costs, to IT who wonders how difficult a product is to support. ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1486))
- Product marketers (PMMs) use everything product builds as a portfolio of possibilities to achieve go-to-market ends. ([Location 1541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1541))
- At later stages for multi-product companies many move to product suites. This is when product marketing shifts toward the product suite, not the individual product level, or toward customer segments, including verticals. ([Location 1591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1591))
- pull the story together across what's relevant from product to show how a solution is the very best and specific to a vertical's needs. ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1598))
- What product ships, sales can't sell. This can indicate product was created in too much of a “tech-first” vacuum—and there is some failure in the product team process. ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1609))
- PMs and PMMs should be in frequent contact with one another, meeting with the entire product squad an absolute minimum of weekly. ([Location 1630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1630))
- Not everything a company does in marketing is about a product's go-to-market. Marketing specialties like brand, public relations, events, social, or demand generation live at the company level, serving all products and the company's overall goals. Product marketing makes sure the right work is happening in this machinery for their product's go-to-market. ([Location 1667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1667))
- The messaging foundation led by product marketing—often tested by marketing—is how the marketing team knows what to say about a product and in which circumstances to use it. ([Location 1672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1672))
- The strategy foundation led by product marketing in a product go-to-market plan is how marketing teams know the why and when. ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1674))
- This isn't a comprehensive list, but it connects what a marketing team is trying to do with some of the typical activities done ([Location 1678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1678))
- Product marketing is the product's ambassador to the marketing team. They ensure marketing stays aligned with product strategy. ([Location 1703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1703))
- Monthly is a good cadence to look at what's been learned that should be applied into what's planned for the subsequent month. It's also a good cadence for reviewing funnel metrics, ([Location 1744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1744))
- Product marketing is the gate to the necessary product knowledge key for selling. Specifically, they shape it for the market, versus something totally raw coming straight from product teams. ([Location 1781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1781))
- A natural tension exists between sales and product marketing. Sales wants to get it done now. Product marketing wants to get it done right. The most powerful tools in this relationship are (1) reference customers and (2) a sales playbook. ([Location 1784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1784))
- Product marketing then ensures sales is trained on what's most important in the playbook: a demo, competitive response, or how to run a proof-of-concept process. ([Location 1788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1788))
- Product marketing drives its creation at earlier stage companies, but it is always developed hand-in-glove with sales as they confirm what repeatable success looks like. ([Location 1791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1791))
- When done well—and if followed—a good playbook can make an average sales rep successful in a faster than average amount of time. ([Location 1792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1792))
- If customers aren't converting at the end of the process, there is no point in more prospective customers starting it. ([Location 1797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1797))
- As products and markets evolve, the product needs to respond to the customers it wants to grow into. The go-to-market approach must respond to customer and market realities as they are. Each shapes the other. ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1889))
- When I say market fit, I mean discovering “market pull.” What makes a customer need or want your product enough that they take action to learn more, try, or buy. ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1898))
- The questions below don't need to be asked all the time—nor are they the only ones that might be appropriate to ask—but the collective discovery work done should answer these more market-oriented questions. ([Location 1926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=1926))
- here are some example product marketing OKRs: ([Location 2139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=2139))
- If you're most concerned about enabling revenue, product marketing OKRs will be more aligned with sales objectives. If you're most concerned about market positioning or building awareness, OKRs will focus more on work done together with marketing. ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=2144))
- the role's bigger purpose: driving product adoption by shaping market perception through strategic marketing activities that meet business goals. ([Location 2265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=2265))
- In modern marketing, technographics (technologies used), firmographics (size, geography, industry), behaviors (likelihood to buy), intent (looking at competitive websites, reading content online), product usage (features most used by customers who renew), browsing history, and the actions of people inside a company (referred to as “account-based” actions) all shape how marketers segment or target a market. ([Location 2311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=2311))
- Any multiproduct tech company must have a broader brand strategy. There are three brand levels to pay attention to: company (e.g. Apple), line of business or key brand (e.g. Music, TV, Watch, iPhone, Mac), and products (e.g. MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac) ([Location 2480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=2480))
- Larger company brand strategy often determines how an individual product gets marketed. A product's go-to-market can be driven by the importance of a line-of-business to a company. For example, when I was on the Office team, Word's marketing was reduced to a small number of features that supported marketing Office as an integrated productivity suite. ([Location 2488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=2488))
- Often when people think their product has a pricing problem, the real problem is the perceived value isn't there. Price was set relative to similar products in the same category, not to market sentiment or brand perceptions. ([Location 2562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=2562))
- Brand is about what people aspire to be—a good mom, a capable leader, an innovator, eternally young—and the best ones make us feel good about ourselves. ([Location 2693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=2693))
- Take the time to reach out to customers with high NPS scores and ask them if they'd be willing to write reviews on a comparison site or do a video testimonial. Or just send them a thank-you gift to delight them. ([Location 2714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=2714))
- Positioning is the place your product holds in the minds of customers. It's how customers know what you do and how you differ from what's already out there. ([Location 3077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3077))
- Messaging includes the key things you say to reinforce your positioning, making you credible so people want to learn more. ([Location 3079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3079))
- Positioning is your long game. Messaging is your short game. ([Location 3080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3080))
- Positioning always starts with elements of messaging, ([Location 3092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3092))
- An assessment guide with strict evaluation criteria—reinforcing your position—frames how customers look not just at your product but at the competitors. ([Location 3093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3093))
- Word-of-mouth elements like comparison sites, reviews, ratings, social postings, shares, online forums, other people's content, and even employee buzz all play a role. ([Location 3097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3097))
- positioning should be thought of as the outcome of all the activities done for a product go-to-market, not just its messaging. ([Location 3101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3101))
- Bad product messaging is easy to spot. After reading it, you still don't know what something does. ([Location 3107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3107))
- Good messaging feels natural and obvious. It's harder to see what makes it good: anticipating what people need to hear—be it just the facts to something more aspirational. ([Location 3108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3108))
- Formulating it is a process, starting with Fundamental 1: deep insight into customers and the market, ([Location 3113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3113))
- You're trying to understand how prospective customers see their world. What do they already believe to be true? Discover their knowledge gaps. You want your messaging to bridge them. ([Location 3114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3114))
- Getting there takes an unvarnished understanding of your target market's daily lives. The best way to get this is through direct conversations with them. Ask open-ended questions like: Tell me what your average day looks like. What really frustrates you in how you do your job? What keeps you up at night? ([Location 3172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09X2B2N2J&location=3172))
