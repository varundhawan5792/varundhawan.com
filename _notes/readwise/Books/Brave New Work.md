## Highlights
- People Positive and Complexity Conscious—two foundational mindsets that we’ll explore in detail. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=417))
- Bigger companies were slower, less innovative, and less human places. People there were constantly wearing masks that hid their true selves, trading the long term for the short term, and actively disempowering their colleagues—it was everything I didn’t want. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=461))
- Was there a way to run a company that didn’t end in a bureaucratic mess? Was agility at scale even possible? Was growth a goal or a by-product? ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=465))
- They represented a way of working known as self-management, characterized by a lack of traditional hierarchy and bureaucracy. These Evolutionary Organizations had been out there all along, but somehow popular business culture had managed to ignore their stories ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=469))
- “A finger pointing at the moon is not the moon.” When we focus too much on the method or the messenger, we lose sight of the deeper truth. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=530))
- Implicit in these principles was the idea that the thinking (the work for which management was “better fitted”) and the doing (the hard labor) were to be separated once and for all. This is perhaps the most pronounced aspect of Taylor’s legacy. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=578))
- Henry Gantt gave us the chart that bears his name— ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=587))
- In Gantt’s repetitive world of manufacturing, this was tolerable, even helpful. But as his practices fanned out into knowledge work, they became a dangerous addiction. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=589))
- bureaucracy. For most people, the term evokes a feeling of soul-crushing inefficiency and boredom. ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=620))
- I define organizational debt as any structure or policy that no longer serves an organization. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=646))
- One of the most common sources of org debt is the knee-jerk reaction. Every time something goes wrong, we immediately jump to create a constraint that will prevent future mistakes. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=647))
- This increase in complication creates more risk, so we create derivative roles and rules to manage it ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=650))
- Another source of org debt is change. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=653))
- to avoid the pitfalls of organizational debt, we need constant and vigilant simplification. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=659))
- Unfortunately, the very bureaucracy that created our org debt also stands in the way of addressing it. Org debt creates bureaucracy, and bureaucracy protects org debt. It’s a tragic love affair. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=660))
- “In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=685))
- Executives are increasingly compensated in stock (in order to align their interests with those of shareholders), and so they all fall victim to a kind of collective quarterly myopia. They need to move the needle now, and that means revenue or earnings growth ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=687))
- Corporate return on assets—the ratio of a company’s profits to what it owns and owes—is one of the best holistic measures of performance. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=691))
- Corporations might be getting bigger, but they’re not getting better at generating value from their assets. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=696))
- So what do they do when investors come calling? They cannibalize themselves. They cut costs in research and development. They centralize functions. They conduct layoff after layoff. ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=697))
- mergers and acquisitions don’t work, or at least not the way we’ve been led to believe. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=706))
- “Too big to fail” and “too few to choose” are the new normal. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=715))
- the firm exit rate—the number of business deaths as a share of all firms—crossed the entry rate in 2008 ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=719))
- Imagine fourteen thousand healthcare workers managed by a headquarters of fewer than fifty people. How on Earth is this possible? It’s actually quite simple. Don’t manage them. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=745))
- They make better decisions faster. They allocate resources dynamically. They form and disband teams fluidly. They innovate both product and process. They grow without losing the culture they love. They work fewer hours but get more done. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=768))
- Evolutionary Organizations may operate in vastly different categories and cultures, yet what I’ve found in talking to them is that these communities all share two crucial mindsets. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=779))
- When it comes to human nature, development, and motivation, they are People Positive. But they also share a deep appreciation for the dynamic and interconnected context in which we operate, a mindset I refer to as Complexity Conscious. ([Location 780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=780))
- our way of working is a reflection of our assumptions and beliefs about human nature. Are we trustworthy or undependable? Are we lazy or industrious? Can we self-manage or must we be controlled? ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=805))
- The dominant view, the one held by Legacy Organizations the world over, paints a mechanistic picture of who we are—conditioned by rewards and punishments, our futures dictated by our pasts. This mindset assumes that we don’t really want to work or learn without an incentive to do so. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=808))
- The minority view, the one held by FAVI, Buurtzorg, and Evolutionary Organizations everywhere, contends that we have an innate desire to fulfill our potential and self-actualize. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=810))
- Ultimately, the People Positive leader believes that when it comes to human beings, we show up the way we are expected to show up—the way we are treated. ([Location 814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=814))
- Commitment to objectives is a function of the rewards [in terms of ego and self-actualization] associated with their achievement. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=840))
- As individuals, we each identify with Theory Y. I want to achieve great things. I am creative. I am responsible. But what about everyone else … our colleagues? It’s much easier to label them as Theory X. ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=846))
- If you place someone in a workplace that pays them by the hour, scrutinizes their every move, and treats them like they are disposable, they may (gasp) present with Theory X behavior. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=849))
- If you hear words such as “incentivize … control … enforce …” and phrases such as “they can’t handle … they don’t need to know … they don’t get it …,” chances are Theory X is driving a lot of the decision making in your organization, ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=852))
- we have three innate psychological needs that drive and shape our behavior: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Perhaps the most important among these is autonomy—the ability to make choices and direct our own lives, free from the control of others. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=865))
- In the context of work, the implications are pretty simple. Increase autonomy, and motivation thrives. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=869))
- We know what complexity feels like. But most of us don’t know what it actually means. We use words such as “complicated” and “complex” interchangeably, ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=889))
- Contrary to popular opinion, among people who study systems theory, “complicated” and “complex” are distinct words with precise meanings. ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=896))
- A complicated system is a causal system—meaning it is subject to cause and effect. Although it may have many parts, they will interact with one another in highly predictable ways. ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=898))
- a complicated system can be fixed with a high degree of confidence. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=900))
- Quite the contrary. Understanding a complicated system, such as an engine or a 3-D printer, requires specialized expertise and experience. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=901))
- A complex system is not causal, it’s dispositional. We can make informed guesses about what it is likely to do (its disposition), but we can’t be sure. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=904))
- Unlike complicated problems, complex problems cannot be solved, only managed. They cannot be controlled, only nudged. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=905))
- complex systems are more about the relationships and interactions among their components than about the components themselves. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=910))
- Software is complicated. Creating a software startup is complex. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=912))
- While many of the activities and outputs of organizations are indeed complicated, the organization itself is complex. Accordingly, organizational culture isn’t a problem to be solved; it’s an emergent phenomenon that we have to cultivate. ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=917))
- Complexity Conscious leaders view performance as the result of collective intelligence, emergence, and self-regulation. If we can just create the right conditions, everyone will continually find ways to achieve our goals. ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=923))
- How many companies have tried to change their cultural values with posters and polo shirts? ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=928))
- Say you’re the CEO of a company where travel spending has spiraled out of control. Your CFO is pushing for a solution. What do you do? ([Location 930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=930))
- You could approach this issue like a signal-controlled intersection. Institute a travel freeze. Create a policy that sets a spending cap on short, medium, and long-haul travel. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=931))
- Or you could try to create a solution that is a bit more like a roundabout. Share total travel spend by team (or by individual) with everyone in the company transparently, so they can see how they compare. Share industry averages and historical averages for your firm. Ask for everyone’s help in optimizing spend, illustrating how it will drive overall profitability ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=934))
- Why do we reject innovative approaches when they are clearly better? Behavioral economists have a name for this: the status quo bias. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=953))
- We may like to think we’re making rational choices all the time, but the fact is we’re biased. We prefer to stick with what we’ve got. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=960))
- We strive for improvements—better bosses! simpler budgets! fewer layers!—but they’re inherently incremental. ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=963))
- But incremental improvement can be a trap. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=964))
- “It’s often easier to make something 10 times better than it is to make it 10 percent better …. Because when you’re working to make things 10 percent better, you inevitably focus on the existing tools and assumptions, and on building on top of an existing solution that many people have already spent a lot of time thinking about ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D93TF33&location=966))
