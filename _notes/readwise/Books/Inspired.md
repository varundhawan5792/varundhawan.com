## Highlights
- 1980s, I was a young software engineer working for Hewlett Packard on a high‐profile product. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=601))
- We trained the sales force. We previewed our technology with the press and received excellent reviews. We were ready. We released. We celebrated the release. Just one problem: No one bought it. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=609))
- I learned that the decisions about what to build came from a product manager—someone who generally resided in the marketing organization ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=618))
- product management wasn't something HP was particularly good at. ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=620))
- Over the next 30 years, I have had the very good fortune to work on some of the most successful high‐tech products ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=623))
- company—there are a tremendous number of stakeholders throughout the business working hard to protect what the company has created. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=752))
- putting up so many obstacles to new ideas that few people are willing or able to drive the company in a new direction. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=755))
- As you can see, everything starts with ideas. ([Location 780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=780))
- most companies want to prioritize those ideas into a roadmap, and they do this for two main reasons. First, they want us to work on the most important things first, and second, they want to be able to predict when things will be ready. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=783))
- there is usually some form of quarterly or annual planning session ([Location 786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=786))
- But in order to prioritize, they first need some form of a business case for each item. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=787))
- either way it boils down to the need to know two things about each idea: (1) How much money or value will it make? and (2) How much money or time will it cost? ([Location 789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=789))
- Once an idea makes it to the top of the list, the first thing that's done is for a product manager to talk to the stakeholders to flesh out the idea and to come up with a set of “requirements. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=793))
- Their purpose is to communicate with the designers and engineers what needs to be built. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=795))
- the user experience design team (assuming the company has such a team), is asked to provide the interaction design, the visual design, ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=797))
- Once we get the green light from QA, the new idea is finally deployed to actual customers. ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=805))
- Yet these same companies consistently complain about the lack of innovation and the very long time it takes to make it from idea to customers' hands. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=808))
- while almost everyone today claims to be Agile, what I've just described is very much a waterfall process. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=810))
- We need to discover the product to be built, and we need to deliver that product to market ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=949))
- We are always working in parallel to both discover the necessary product to be built—which is primarily what the product manager and designer work on every day—while the engineers work to deliver production‐quality product. ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=956))
- the engineers are also helping daily on discovery (and many of the best innovations come from that participation, so this is not a minor point), ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=959))
- The output of product discovery is a validated product backlog. ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=967))
- Missionaries are true believers in the vision and are committed to solving problems for their customers. In a dedicated product team, the team acts and feels a lot like a startup within the larger company, ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1065))
- There are essentially three ways for a product manager to work, and I argue only one of them leads to success: ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1200))
- The honest truth is that the product manager needs to be among the strongest talent in the company. ([Location 1217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1217))
- So, this chapter is really about what you need to do to succeed at this job. In that spirit, there are four key responsibilities of a strong product manager; four things that the rest of your team is counting on you to bring to the party: ([Location 1245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1245))
- four critical contributions you need to bring to your team: deep knowledge (1) of your customer, (2) of the data, (3) of your business and its stakeholders, and (4) of your market and industry. ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1293))
- The successful product manager must be the very best versions of smart, creative, and persistent. ([Location 1308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1308))
- intellectually curious, quickly learning and applying new technologies to solve problems for customers, ([Location 1314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1314))
- mean thinking outside the normal product box ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1315))
- pushing companies way beyond their comfort zone with compelling evidence, constant communication, and building bridges across functions ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1317))
- Pretty much any other role on a product team is better if you're looking for a good work‐life balance. Now, I know it may not be politically correct to say that, but I don't think I'm doing you any favors by misleading you. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1323))
- product manager is most similar to is the role of the CEO. But with the obvious difference that, unlike the CEO, the product manager is not the boss of anyone. ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1353))
- The product manager must ensure a business outcome, not just ensure a product gets defined. ([Location 1355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1355))
- great products require an intense collaboration with design and engineering to solve real problems for your users and customers, in ways that meet the needs of your business. ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1362))
- the product designer is measured on the success of the product. ([Location 1425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1425))
- They are deeply oriented around actual customers and the value their product brings to those customers. ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1426))
- UX is any way that customers and end users realize the value provided by your product. It includes all the touch points and interactions a customer has with your company and product over time. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1432))
- Good product designers use prototypes as their primary canvas for communicating ideas, ([Location 1450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1450))
- they build testing into their weekly cadence, so they're able to constantly validate and refine ideas as well as collect new insights they might not have been looking for. ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1454))
- Product designers and their product teams utilize the opportunity to assess the value of their ideas. ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1457))
- Modern product designers may have different strengths but, generally, have some level of skill with both interaction and visual design. Having a more complete tool set allows them to work quickly at different levels of fidelity, depending on the context. ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1464))
- We need design—not just as a service to make our product beautiful—but to discover the right product. ([Location 1500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1500))
- Once you get a designer dedicated to your product team, here are five keys to a successful and healthy relationship with your designer: ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1504))
- The key to tapping into the real value that these user researchers can provide is to keep in mind that the learning must be shared learning. ([Location 1637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1637))
- If your company does not have user researchers, then your product designer will typically pick up these responsibilities for your team. ([Location 1641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1641))
- There are so many interactions and interdependencies—and so much necessary institutional knowledge of the business and the users and the customer journey—that at least one person must review everything going on with the product that is going to be visible to the user. ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1752))
- leaders—the head of product, the head of design, and the head of technology—are obviously very valuable individually, but in combination you can see their real power. This is why my personal preference is to have these three people sit very close to one another, sometimes in the same physical office. ([Location 1785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1785))
- Realize that typical product roadmaps are all about output. Yet, good teams are asked to deliver business results. ([Location 2227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2227))
- They don't usually include little things like bugs and optimizations, but they do normally contain the requested features, projects, and big, multi‐team efforts often called initiatives. And they typically include due dates or at least time frames for when each item is expected to be delivered. ([Location 2233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2233))
- If we can prototype and test ideas with users, customers, engineers, and business stakeholders in hours and days—rather than in weeks and months—it changes the dynamics, and most important, the results. ([Location 2280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2280))
- The idea behind business objectives is simple enough: tell the team what you need them to accomplish and how the results will be measured, and let the team figure out the best way to solve the problems. ([Location 2313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2313))
- That's a good example of a business objective for one or more product teams: “Dramatically reduce the time it takes for a new customer to go live.” And one of the measurable key results would be “Average new customer onboarding time less than three hours.” ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2317))
- the root cause of all this grief about commitments is when these commitments are made. They are made too early. They are made before we know whether we can deliver on this obligation, and even more important, whether what we deliver will solve the problem for the customer. ([Location 2366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2366))
- Mission statements are useful, but they don't say anything about how we plan on accomplishing that. That's what the product vision is for. ([Location 2399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2399))
- The product strategy is our sequence of products or releases we plan to deliver on the path to realizing the product vision. ([Location 2417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2417))
- sometimes, the product strategy is based on achieving a set of key milestones in some sort of logical and important order. ([Location 2432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2432))
- The more product teams you have, the more essential it is to have this unifying vision and strategy for each team to be able to make good choices. ([Location 2452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2452))
- the idea is not that every product team has its own product vision. That would miss the point. The idea is that our organization has a product vision, and all the product teams in that organization are helping to contribute to making that vision a reality. ([Location 2454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2454))
- Leadership inspires and sets the direction, and management helps get us there. ([Location 2459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2459))
- the product vision should be inspiring, and the product strategy should be focused. ([Location 2461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2461))
- You can make any product vision meaningful if you focus on how you genuinely help your users and customers. ([Location 2496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2496))
- What's hard is to help the organization understand how those trends can be leveraged by your products to solve customer problems in new and better ways. ([Location 2498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2498))
- Realize that any product vision is a leap of faith. If you could truly validate a vision, then your vision probably isn't ambitious enough. ([Location 2508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2508))
- “Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.” ([Location 2578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2578))
- “When performance is measured by results.” ([Location 2579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2579))
- for the product management, design, and technology organization, focus on the organization's objectives and the objectives for each product team, which are designed to roll up and achieve the organization's objectives. ([Location 2600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2600))
- when organizations first start with OKRs, there's a common tendency to have each functional department create their own OKRs for their own organization. ([Location 2651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2651))
- The problem is that the individual members of each of these functional departments are the actual members of a cross‐functional ([Location 2654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2654))
- but each person on the team may have their own set of objectives that cascade down through their functional manager. ([Location 2657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2657))
- What all too often happens in this case is that the people on the product teams are conflicted as to where they should be spending their time. This results in confusion, frustration, and disappointing results ([Location 2663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2663))
- If different functional organizations (such as design, engineering, or quality assurance) have larger objectives (such as responsive design, technical debt, and test automation), they should be discussed and prioritized at the leadership team level along with the other business objectives, and then incorporated into the relevant product team's objectives. ([Location 2670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2670))
- it's not a problem for managers of the functional areas to have individual objectives relating to their organization. ([Location 2672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2672))
- It's also not normally a big problem if individual contributors (such as a particular engineer, designer, or product manager) has a small number of personal growth‐related objectives ([Location 2677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2677))
- Leadership (especially the head of product, head of technology, and head of design) will need to discuss the company objectives and which teams are best suited to pursue each objective. ([Location 2711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2711))
- we lean on management to help connect the dots between teams. ([Location 2723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2723))
- making sure there are enough customers that even need this solution (the demand) and then coming up with a solution that works for our customers and for our business. ([Location 2839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2839))
- we need to make sure we come up with a single solution that works for many customers, and not a series of specials. ([Location 2840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2840))
- While you'll never have 100 percent confidence, you should not have to release and pray. ([Location 2844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2844))
- I have on occasion been called out for pushing hard one minute for the team to be much more aggressive in getting out to customers and getting early feedback on their ideas, and then just minutes later pushing that same team hard not to compromise their standards on releasing scalable, fault‐tolerant, reliable, high‐performance, secure software. ([Location 2850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2850))
- what is really meant when we call something a “product” or “product‐quality” or “productized” or “live in production.” ([Location 2864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2864))
- the purpose of product discovery is to make sure we have some evidence that when we ask the engineers to build a production‐quality product, it won't be a wasted effort. ([Location 2872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2872))
- If you are an early stage startup and you have no customers, then of course this is not really an issue (and it's very likely premature to even be creating production‐quality software). ([Location 2879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2879))
- If you want to discover great products, it really is essential that you get your ideas in front of real users and customers early and often. If you want to deliver great products, you want to use best practices for engineering and try not to override the engineers' concerns. ([Location 2884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2884))
- we also have the concept of an iteration in discovery. We loosely define an iteration in discovery as trying out at least one new idea or approach. ([Location 2974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2974))
- the purpose of discovery is to do this much faster and cheaper than we can do in delivery. ([Location 2976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2976))
- modern discovery techniques can generally test on the order of 10–20 iterations per week. ([Location 2978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=2978))
- if they could only pick a single technique, the one I'd recommend is the customer discovery program. ([Location 3280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3280))
- These are two‐dimensional maps, in which major user activities are arrayed along the horizontal dimension, loosely ordered by time from left to right. ([Location 3298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3298))
- We are looking for prospective customers that truly feel the pain and are near desperate for the solution we want to build. ([Location 3390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3390))
- We need them to have people and time willing to work closely with us. ([Location 3394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3394))
- Your job is to dive deep with each of the six customers and identify a single solution that works well for all six customers. ([Location 3411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3411))
- You can take their money after you deliver them a product they love. ([Location 3416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3416))
- Make sure you release the delivered product to these people before the general release, and make sure they are live and happy before the release. ([Location 3442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3442))
- The result of the program is a set of reference applications rather than reference customers. ([Location 3448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3448))
- we pick six to eight well‐respected, influential internal users/employees—the individuals that the other agents look up to as thought leaders—and we work closely with them to discover the necessary product. ([Location 3453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3453))
- It certainly shows up in terms of happier customers, lower churn rates, shortened sales cycles, and rapid organic growth. ([Location 3478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3478))
- you can follow it up with a user test of your latest product ideas. ([Location 3613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3613))
- yes, some people get themselves into trouble trying to use the wrong type of prototype for the job at hand. ([Location 3721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3721))
- The overarching purpose of any form of prototype is to learn something at a much lower cost in terms of time and effort than building out a product. ([Location 3758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3758))
- force you to think through a problem at a substantially deeper level than if we just talk about it ([Location 3761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3761))
- Members of the product team and business partners can all experience the prototype to develop shared understanding. ([Location 3764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3764))
- we create the right level of fidelity for its intended purpose, and we acknowledge that lower fidelity is faster and cheaper than higher fidelity, ([Location 3770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3770))
- communicate to the engineers and the broader organization what needs to be built. This is often referred to as prototype as spec. ([Location 3773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3773))
- most of the time the feasibility prototype is intended to be throwaway code—it's okay and normal to be quick and dirty with this. ([Location 3795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3795))
- Low‐fidelity user prototypes, however, represent only one dimension of your product—the information and the workflow—there's nothing there about the impact of visual design ([Location 3822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3822))
- A high‐fidelity user prototype is still a simulation; however, now it looks and feels very real. ([Location 3825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3825))
- The data you see is very realistic, ([Location 3826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3826))
- The big limitation of a user prototype is that it's not good for proving anything ([Location 3840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3840))
- Where a lot of novice product people go sideways is when they create a high‐fidelity user prototype and they put it in front of 10 or 15 people who all say how much they love it. They think they've validated their product, but unfortunately, that's not how it works. ([Location 3841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3841))
- A Wizard of Oz prototype combines the front‐end user experience of a high‐fidelity user prototype but with an actual person behind the scenes performing manually what would ultimately be handled by automation. ([Location 3892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3892))
- we usually assess usability and value with the same users and customers at the same time. ([Location 3927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3927))
- you won't be as proficient as a trained user researcher—at least at first—and it'll take you a few sessions to get the hang of it, but, in most cases, you'll find that you can still identify the serious issues and friction points with your product, which is what's important. ([Location 3952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3952))
- you can set up an SEM campaign using Google AdWords to recruit users (which is especially good if you are looking for users that are in the moment of trying to use a product like yours). ([Location 3963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3963))
- You can always go to where your users congregate. Trade shows for business software, shopping centers for e‐commerce, ([Location 3968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3968))
- Most of the time, when we do a usability and/or value test, it's with the product manager, the product designer, and one of the engineers from the team ([Location 3977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3977))
- If you have a user researcher helping with the actual testing, they will typically administer the test, but absolutely the product manager and designer must be there for each and every test. ([Location 3980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3980))
- You will need to define in advance the set of tasks that you want to test. ([Location 3981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3981))
- concentrate on the primary tasks—the ones that users will do most of the time. ([Location 3983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3983))
- First, we train the product managers and designers on how to conduct themselves, and second, we make sure the test happens quickly—before they fall in love with their own ideas. ([Location 3986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3986))
- The other environment that works really well is your customer's office. ([Location 3995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3995))
- You can also learn from seeing what their office looks like. How big is their monitor? How fast is their computer and network connectivity? How do they communicate with their colleagues on their work tasks? ([Location 3997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=3997))
- Explain that she won't be hurting your feelings by giving her candid feedback, good or bad. You're testing the ideas in the prototype, you're not testing her. She can't pass or fail—only the prototype can pass or fail. ([Location 4011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4011))
- What matters is whether users can easily do the tasks they need to do. It really doesn't matter if the user thinks something on the page is ugly or should be moved or changed. ([Location 4018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4018))
- watch what they do more than what they say. ([Location 4021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4021))
- When we see someone struggle, most of us have a natural urge to help the person out. You need to suppress that urge. ([Location 4022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4022))
- Sometimes people will give up quickly, so you may need to encourage them to keep trying a bit longer. ([Location 4025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4025))
- you'll want to avoid giving any help or leading the witness in any way. ([Location 4027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4027))
- Some people ask users to keep a running narration of what they're thinking, but I find this tends to put people in critique mode, as it's not a natural behavior. ([Location 4030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4030))
- Act like a parrot. ([Location 4031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4031))
- They'll almost always ask for an e‐mail when the product is out if they like what they see. And, if they really like it, they'll try to get it early from you. ([Location 4043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4043))
- but as soon as you think you've identified an issue, just fix it in the prototype. There's no law that says you have to keep the test identical for all of your test subjects. ([Location 4048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4048))
- We're not trying to prove anything here; we're just trying to learn quickly. ([Location 4050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4050))
- So many companies and product teams think all they need to do is match the features (referred to as feature parity), and then they don't understand why their product doesn't sell, even at a lower price. ([Location 4066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4066))
- The customer must perceive your product to be substantially better ([Location 4068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4068))
- If the value is there, we can fix everything else. ([Location 4071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4071))
- if we could come up with an amazing solution to this problem, do customers even care about this problem? Enough to buy a new product and switch to it? ([Location 4078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4078))
- The real challenge in that situation is whether we can come up with a demonstrably better solution in terms of value than the alternatives. ([Location 4082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4082))
- The demand‐testing technique is called a fake door demand test. The idea is that we put the button or menu item into the user experience exactly where we believe it should be. ([Location 4113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4113))
- takes the user to a special page that explains that you are studying the possibility of adding this new feature, and you are seeking customers to talk to about this. The page also provides a way for the user to volunteer ([Location 4115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4115))
- The same basic concept applies to entire products. Rather than a button on a page, we set up the landing page for the new offering's product funnel. This is called a landing page demand test. ([Location 4121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4121))
- If you stop innovating, you will die. Maybe not immediately, but if all you do is optimize your existing solutions, and you stop innovating, it is only a matter of time before you are someone else's lunch. ([Location 4154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4154))
- two really big things—protect your revenue and brand, and protect your employees and customers. ([Location 4160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4160))
- customers that feel like your product is a moving target that they have to constantly relearn won't be happy customers for long. ([Location 4175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4175))
- continuous deployment is a very powerful gentle deployment technique, and when used properly along with customer impact assessment, it is a powerful tool for protecting our customers. ([Location 4177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4177))
- If you are at a larger, enterprise company, know that you absolutely must move aggressively to continuously improve your product, well beyond small optimizations. ([Location 4184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4184))
- Quantitative testing tells us what's happening (or not), but it can't tell us why, and what to do to correct the situation. That's why we do qualitative testing. ([Location 4191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4191))
- Qualitative testing is about rapid learning and big insights. ([Location 4194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4194))
- after a usability test the user knows what your product is all about and how it's meant to be used. Only then can we have a useful conversation with the user about value ([Location 4212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4212))
- Preparing a value test therefore includes preparing a usability test. ([Location 4213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4213))
- focus groups might be helpful for gaining market insights, but they are not helpful in discovering the product we need to deliver ([Location 4218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4218))
- High‐fidelity means it feels very realistic, which turns out to be especially important for value testing. ([Location 4224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4224))
- our tests for value are designed to make sure the person is not just being nice to you. ([Location 4230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4230))
- Especially with businesses, you can also ask the person if they'd be willing to schedule some significant time with you to work on this ([Location 4244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4244))
- As product manager, you need to make sure you are at every single qualitative value test. ([Location 4266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4266))
- If you worked for me, the continuation of your monthly salary would depend on this. ([Location 4270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4270))
- It is a qualitative usability and value‐testing technique, and we let the user drive. ([Location 4561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4561))
- This is a sales or persuasive tool. ([Location 4564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4564))
- The purpose is to give the stakeholder every opportunity to spot a problem. ([Location 4571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4571))
- I have seen many inexperienced product managers do a walkthrough with a prospective customer when they should have prepared a product demo. Or another really common rookie mistake is to do a product demo during a user test, and then ask the user what they think. ([Location 4575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4575))
- it is all too easy to institute processes that govern how you produce products that can bring innovation to a grinding halt. ([Location 4770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4770))
- presentations are notoriously terrible for testing business viability. The reason is that they are far too ambiguous. ([Location 4843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4843))
- I plead with product managers in larger companies to not trust a sign‐off on anything other than a high‐fidelity prototype. ([Location 4847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4847))
- group setting is not the forum for designing strong products. It results in design by committee, ([Location 4850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4850))
- meet privately with each stakeholder, show them the high‐fidelity prototype, and give them the chance to raise any concerns. ([Location 4851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4851))
- The first is to have a very strong and very intentional product culture, and to have that culture very well established ([Location 4891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4891))
- company that takes pride in how they work and in using best practices. ([Location 4892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4892))
- make this explicit in the interview and onboarding process. ([Location 4894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4894))
- cover the bigger learnings and not the minor things—what worked, what didn't work, and what the teams are planning to try the following week. ([Location 4910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4910))
- move fast and kept at the big learnings level, ([Location 4911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4911))
- easy way for the various product teams to keep apprised of what other teams are learning, ([Location 4918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4918))
- encourages the product teams to keep their focus on big learnings ([Location 4919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4919))
- critical that the organization understand that discovery and innovation is about continuously running these rapid experiments and learning ([Location 4920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4920))
- important culturally that the product organization be transparent and generous in what they learn and how they work. ([Location 4922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4922))
- The product strategy needs to spell out a logical and intentional sequence of target markets for the product teams to focus on. ([Location 5042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5042))
- empowerment means the teams are able to tackle and solve the business problems they've been assigned in the best way they see fit. ([Location 5055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5055))
- in a product‐mind set organization, the product teams exist to serve the company's customers in ways that meet the needs of the business. ([Location 5058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5058))
- be sure that your teams have the room to also pursue harder and more impactful problems. ([Location 5062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5062))
- What does it really mean to have a strong innovation culture? ([Location 5115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5115))
- people feel like they are in wartime, and that if they don't find a way to move fast, ([Location 5127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5127))
