## Highlights
- changing outer behavior and results in a change of outer behavior — what you say, what you wear, how you move ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=221))
- when you change your beliefs and mindsets, the behavior follows. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=223))
- Your failures happen because you grew up emotionally ill equipped to deal with women, and more specifically, intimacy. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=227))
- Our culture has become stationary. We spend our time sitting behind desks, behind screens, and in cars. We don’t move like we used to and we don’t feel like we used to. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=283))
- The less needy he is, the more attractive he will be to women on average. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=293))
- Neediness is when a man places a higher priority on others’ perceptions of him ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=295))
- A man’s respect for differing opinions makes those around him want to agree with him more. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=307))
- A needy man will be more invested in the woman he is with than in himself – he will be more concerned about her opinion, about him, about the weather, about everything other than what he actually thinks and feels. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=315))
- By investment, I mean the degree to which you sacrifice/alter your own thoughts, feelings, and motivations for someone else. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=319))
- you should not be willing to sacrifice your thoughts, feelings, and motivations for someone else more than they sacrifice theirs for you. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=321))
- be the man who controls his own destiny, is unfazed by the threats others may pose to him and who shrugs it off if he pursues a woman and she has no interest in him? ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=331))
- women can be needy as well. And although neediness is a turn-off for most men, it’s not the complete deal breaker that it is for women. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=345))
- To most women, a man with no neediness is like a woman with perfect tits and a gorgeously sculpted ass. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=346))
- It’s important to note that non-neediness doesn’t mean you should only care about yourself. This is narcissism, ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=348))
- When you are attracted to a woman, you should be affected by her, you should be invested in her. That’s the whole fun of it! That’s the reason we have relationships in the first place, to be touched and moved by others. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=351))
- the fact is that female sexual attraction is based largely in feeling comfortable and secure with a man she meets. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=403))
- This is why status is based on behavior and not simply assets. ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=406))
- women tend to be less invested and more confident early in on the interaction. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=410))
- When a man approaches her and induces her to become as invested in him as he is in her, this is the process of seduction. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=411))
- The second method (a man demonstrating less investment) is a passive process that he does within himself and that permeates every aspect of his behavior over the long-term. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=419))
- It only requires one to move his yardstick for success from external goals (more dates, more sex) to internal goals (better relationships, more emotional fulfillment, overall happiness). ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=421))
- Overcoming your neediness comes through a change in your mindset, your self-perception, and your self-respect. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=538))
- before meeting a woman, instead of worrying whether or not she will like you, you could wonder if you will like her. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=541))
- instead of sitting there silently wondering what to say next to make her like you, you could sit there silently wondering what she will say to make you like her. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=544))
- instead of looking for a conversation she’ll enjoy, you could talk about something you enjoy and see if she takes interest. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=551))
- Only making time for people who make time for you. Only being interested in dating people who are interested in dating you. Worrying about what will make you happy instead of what will make someone else happy. ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=557))
- ironically, that is what women want you to be: a man who wants to be who he wants to be. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=561))
- The only real dating advice is self-improvement. Work on yourself. Conquer your anxieties. Resolve your shame. Take care of yourself and those who are important to you. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=572))
- Non-needy men look for that intersection where they can get both their own needs and their partner’s needs met. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=588))
- Whereas a needy man will play at being meek and unimportant in order to get approval from others, the narcissist proclaims his own greatness to get approval from others. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=599))
- Narcissistic men see seduction and relationships as another competition to be dominated and won, not as a collaboration to be enjoyed. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=614))
- being narcissistic and overcompensating works. But it leads to unpleasant, shallow, and superficial interactions, constant headaches ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=625))
- if a non-needy man meets a woman who rejects him or is not interested in him, he will assume that it was either an incompatibility or that it was just not the right situation. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=635))
- making yourself vulnerable doesn’t just mean being willing to share your fears or insecurities. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=706))
- It can mean putting yourself in a position where you can be rejected, saying a joke that may not be funny, asserting an opinion that may offend others, introducing yourself to a group of people you don’t know, telling a woman that you like her and want to date her. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=706))
- A man who’s able to make himself vulnerable is saying to the world, “Screw the repercussions; this is who I am, and I refuse to be anyone else.” ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=711))
- “Humans are attracted to each other’s rough edges.” ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=764))
- Show your rough edges. Stop trying to be perfect. Expose yourself and share yourself without inhibition. ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=766))
- “The less you talk about your shame, the more of it you have.” ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=785))
- They’ll like you for your ability to be OK with being rejected, to make mistakes, and to say something stupid. ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=854))
- The man who has some good lines and some bad lines and is able to admit the latter and laugh at the former, this is a man she will trust ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=857))
- Stop looking at communication as the surface information and instead, pay attention to the emotions and motivations behind everything that you do and say. That's where all of the meaning is. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=889))
- everything you say must be as authentic as possible. There’s no shortcut. There are no tricks. You say it because you mean it and mean it because you say it. ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=911))
- Men who are non-needy establish strict boundaries because they value their own time and happiness more than receiving attention from a woman. ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1165))
- When it comes to making yourself more vulnerable, the first step is often to begin establishing your own boundaries. Learn how to say no to people, particularly women. ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1167))
- You must become comfortable with the idea of being inexperienced and be comfortable admitting that insecurity if you wish to gain a lot of experience. ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1208))
- you must come to terms with why you’re seeking attention and approval from other men — maybe it goes as far back as your father — and then seek to find that approval through other means. ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1223))
- Take your co-workers out for beers. Buy season tickets to the local basketball team. There are much healthier ways to get male camaraderie ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1225))
- you can quickly solve it by simply stating to her, “I think you’re cute/pretty/attractive/funny/whatever, want to grab coffee/dinner/a drink sometime?” ([Location 1397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1397))
- The goal with Neutral women is to polarize them through your words and behaviors. This may mean flirting with them or teasing them. It may mean asking her on a date. It may be as simple as smiling at her from across the room. ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1412))
- if you leave her to her neutrality, she will usually become Unreceptive and not see you as dating material. ([Location 1415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1415))
- You can recognize women who are Receptive in two ways: 1) they initiate with you, and/or 2) they reciprocate your actions enthusiastically. ([Location 1418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1418))
- unless you are extremely good-looking or have a great lifestyle or you manage to meet women through good social contacts, few women are going to initiate with you and the few who do won’t initiate often. ([Location 1439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1439))
- a man who does not act on his sexual desires is a man who is needy, lacks vulnerability and is therefore unattractive. ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1503))
- if men have been friends with a woman for even a month or two without ever explicitly indicating their sexual interest in her, it’s likely too late. ([Location 1535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1535))
- If you express your truth and demonstrate not only that you’re non-needy but also frictionless for her (similar interests, values, life situation, etc.), then she will become very Receptive. ([Location 1573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1573))
- Neutral women are where so-called “game” comes into play. Having good game means you can take a woman who is Neutral and incite her to become Receptive to you quickly. You do this by making yourself vulnerable, sharing yourself unabashedly, and polarizing her ([Location 1589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1589))
- I told her I'd like to get to know her a bit better and talk. ([Location 1594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1594))
- "What's your favorite thing in the world?" ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1596))
- Women who share interests with me give me an opportunity to polarize them quickly to being Receptive. ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1598))
- Receptive women who were originally Neutral, if you do not make a move and become physical with them quickly enough, they will often drift back to Neutral ([Location 1612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1612))
- your ability to sort through each type of women and meet as many as possible will be determined by how fearless and bold you are when it comes to meeting women. ([Location 1619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1619))
- You cannot be an attractive and life-changing presence to some women without being a joke or an embarrassment to others. ([Location 1632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1632))
- You have to be controversial. You have to polarize. ([Location 1633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1633))
- learning to open yourself up enough emotionally, learning to express your honest self enough and be comfortable enough with your vulnerability to take those embarrassing moments along with the moments of passion. ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1634))
- The amazing thing about polarization is that the simple act of doing it demonstrates non-neediness and will then inspire more Neutral women to become Receptive ([Location 1641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1641))
- The men who employ this strategy employ it because they’re trying to avoid confrontation and controversy. Many of these men have been avoiding confrontation and controversy their entire lives. ([Location 1646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1646))
- sexuality, attraction, and relationships are, by their very nature, confrontational and controversial. ([Location 1649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1649))
- A man who is uninhibited about expressing his emotions and what he wants will demonstrate non-neediness, thereby attracting ([Location 1662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1662))
- You’d be surprised how many women will respond with attraction to nothing other than a man who is bold and willing to stick his neck out. ([Location 1664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1664))
- polarizing women is more important than being pleasant to them. ([Location 1731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1731))
- There are a million extraneous circumstances completely outside of your control and at any given time, a large chunk of the women you meet and talk to are going to be experiencing one of them. The best you can do is to let it go and remember: it’s not about you. ([Location 1755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1755))
- This is why we approach women looking to see if she fits our values and needs and not the other way around. ([Location 1759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1759))
- Instead of thinking, “I hope she doesn’t reject me,” think, “I hope I'll find out if she’s right for me.” ([Location 1765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1765))
- the point is that if she liked me enough, she’d be willing to work at making it happen with me. And if she doesn’t, then that just means it’s wrong person ([Location 1772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1772))
- The concept of “success” in modern dating advice is often skewed. It’s influenced on the one side from traditional roles and rules — get a nice girlfriend, get married, etc. — and on the other side by unrealistic expectations and social pressures ([Location 1778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1778))
- I define success in a qualitative way: maximizing happiness with whichever woman/women I prefer to be with. ([Location 1796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1796))
- Having a great date with a woman who wants to wait to have sex with you can become a far greater success than that woman who bangs your brains out an hour after meeting you. ([Location 1818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1818))
- We screen through these women by polarizing them. We are polarizing them by sharing our truth with them openly and freely. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1820))
- And not only do we pursue and polarize the women we believe will make us happy, but we also push the interaction. ([Location 1822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1822))
- Open yourself up and find what makes you happy. Yes, that will mean you’ll probably get hurt. But so what? The best things in life don’t come easily. ([Location 1827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1827))
- The three ways are 1) living based on our values (lifestyle); 2) becoming comfortable with our intentions (boldness); and 3) by expressing our sexuality freely (communication). ([Location 1832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1832))
- The Three Fundamentals are: 1. Creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle. 2. Overcoming your fears and anxiety around socializing, intimacy and sexuality. 3. Mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly. ([Location 1849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1849))
- Honest Living, or creating an attractive lifestyle involves really drilling down and understanding what you want as a man for your life and then working to make that a reality. ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1859))
- Because you’re living 40 hours a week, every week, investing your identity in what others want out of you and not what you want of yourself. This is like baseline neediness, and until you straighten this out, you will be needy with every woman you meet, ([Location 1870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1870))
- Honest Living correlates directly with the quality of women that you will attract. ([Location 1874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1874))
- Honest Action is overcoming your fear and anxiety around women. ([Location 1877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1877))
- If you see a beautiful woman and have a desire to meet her, to not take action and meet her is a form of being dishonest with yourself. ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1880))
- If you’re afraid to approach a woman, it’s because somewhere inside you are more invested in her opinion of you than you are in your own opinion of yourself. ([Location 1885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1885))
- Honest Action correlates directly to the quantity of women you meet and attract. ([Location 1893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1893))
- I call it Honest Communication because it’s learning how to communicate your true intentions and emotions to others clearly. ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1898))
- we don’t know the best way to convey those thoughts or feelings. ([Location 1899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1899))
- Honest Communication will determine the efficiency with which you are able to attract women who are compatible to you. ([Location 1901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1901))
- The idea is to become socially connected and fearless at the same time and have an awesome and attractive lifestyle. ([Location 1965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1965))
- The theory of demographics is simple and easy to remember: like attracts like. You attract what you are. ([Location 2005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2005))
- When demographics don’t match up, then it causes friction. And as we learned in Chapter 3, friction prevents attraction from turning into intimacy and/or sex. ([Location 2009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2009))
- if you focus your time and energy on meeting women in situations where they are likely to share your values, interests, and needs — then you’re going to not only experience a much higher degree of success, but you’re going to meet women you enjoy a lot more. ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2068))
- Prioritize what you look for in a woman. This will help you decide where to look. ([Location 2091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2091))
- take a minute and write down things that you’ve always wanted to do but have never had the time or never worked up the nerve to do. Make a promise to yourself to get involved in that activity or event in some way. ([Location 2098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2098))
- Here are examples of some great hobbies/events that you can use to meet women: ([Location 2104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2104))
- meetup.com and livingsocial.com are excellent resources for finding like-minded people and cool events going on in your city. ([Location 2137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2137))
- The idea is that our beliefs are reflected in our behavior, and behavior determines which (and how many) women are attracted to us. ([Location 2167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2167))
- “The only thing all of the women you date have in common is you.” ([Location 2186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2186))
- if all of the women you date are meek and have no personality, then likely there is something in your beliefs and behavior that is naturally screening for those types of women. ([Location 2188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2188))
- You change your beliefs by simply accepting the fact that you don’t know what you’re talking about and then you open yourself to coming to other conclusions. ([Location 2201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2201))
- Go to an event and pretend that all of the women you meet are loving, caring, and honest. Get online and message women imagining that every one of them is interested in you for you and not for some ulterior motive. See what happens. ([Location 2203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2203))
- Age, money, and looks matter — in some cases a lot, in other cases, not a lot, but they still matter. ([Location 2228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2228))
- With that said, age, money, and looks don’t matter nearly as much as most men think. ([Location 2230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2230))
- When it comes to age, studies show that men’s physical attractiveness peaks at around 31 ([Location 2232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2232))
- The older you are, the more money you’re expected to have and the more successful you’re expected to be ([Location 2244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2244))
- women who only care about things such as looks and money are usually going to be women who you’re not going to be interested in or who are not going to make you happy. So you’re not missing out on much. ([Location 2259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2259))
- You should be as good-looking as you can possibly be. And you should be as financially successful as you can possibly be. ([Location 2262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2262))
- The more money/looks/success you have, the less attractive behavior you need. ([Location 2271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2271))
- The key is to 1) recognize your personal interests and strengths, and 2) build upon those personal interests and strengths to quickly attract women in your preferred demographic. ([Location 2290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2290))
- as humans when we see many other people valuing something, we will unconsciously value it ourselves. ([Location 2295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2295))
- cultivate as much social proof within your demographic as possible. ([Location 2306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2306))
- you want to cultivate your connections and put yourself into as big of a leadership position as possible. Don’t just join the intramural ultimate Frisbee team, start organizing it. Don’t just volunteer at a charity event, help find sponsors for it. ([Location 2311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2311))
- Part of living the honest lifestyle is to pursue what you’re passionate about to the fullest extent. ([Location 2314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2314))
- Don’t just pursue your interests, become a leader in your interests. ([Location 2316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2316))
- it is far more powerful to be something attractive rather than to say something attractive. You can say the most attractive sentence in the world, but if it isn’t backed up by who you are, then it’s not going to have any meaning. ([Location 2323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2323))
- What you say is only a means to buy you enough time to show her that identity. Notice I said “show her” not “tell her.” ([Location 2328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2328))
- Not everybody is born good-looking. But any man, with some time and effort, can become attractive. ([Location 2374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2374))
- A makeover and wardrobe change can make meeting and dating women three times easier literally overnight. Not to mention all of the psychological side benefits of making you feel more confident, more interesting, more excited, etc. ([Location 2381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2381))
- fitness and fashion will do more to attract women in a shorter amount of time than anything else you can do. Being in decent shape and dressing well will make every phase of the process easier and smoother, ([Location 2394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2394))
- Attractive men make their opinions known. They’ve had unique experiences and ideas. They’ve tried things many people haven’t tried, done things many people haven’t done, and share their ideas openly and freely. ([Location 2578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2578))
- an attractive man with depth and character is a man who has opinions and openly expresses those opinions. ([Location 2580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2580))
- one thing that will always make you stand out, particularly to women, is if you’ve not only expanded your horizons, but you’ve also made your own decisions about your personal tastes, your experiences, and what you think about various topics. ([Location 2592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2592))
- Here are some concepts to keep in mind as you go through your life experiencing art and media: ([Location 2607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2607))
- Assume everything has a form of value; it’s your job to find it. ([Location 2609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2609))
- Drop all of this prejudice and adopt this mentality immediately: “there has to be something to this form of art, otherwise it wouldn’t have a following, so I should find out what that something is.” ([Location 2611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2611))
- Watch every movie in IMDB’s list of top 20 movies of all time. Google critics’ top 10 movies of all time lists and watch everything on there. Watch every movie that’s ever won an Oscar for “Best Picture.” That’s a good start. ([Location 2619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2619))
- Being a well-rounded individual with opinions will expand your demographics by quite a bit. ([Location 2625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2625))
- If you were lined up next to 10 random, single men from your town, what would make you stand out from them? Imagine a woman met all 10 of you in a row. What is there about you that would stop her dead in her tracks and make her say, "Wow, this man is unique?" ([Location 2651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2651))
- What are your rough edges that people can’t find anywhere else? What have you done that will make you stand out in her mind? ([Location 2657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2657))
- Men often don’t totally believe me, but poor lifestyle choices afflict all of your interactions and communication when it comes to women. Poor lifestyle choices reflect a lack of investment in yourself, which in turn causes you to be less confident around others for validation. ([Location 2667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2667))
- Get your life taken care of. Get healthy. Find a happy group of friends. Find a few hobbies that you love. Develop opinions. Start caring about what you spend your time doing. ([Location 2678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2678))
- it’s being proven over and over that what you say isn’t so important, how you approach isn’t so important. What’s important is that you move things forward without hesitation, without that resistance that you’re obeying right now by doing nothing, by remaining in the status quo ([Location 2769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2769))
- The only important "skill" in dating is learning how to stop buying into your own bullshit, to stop believing your own stories. ([Location 2773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2773))
- And chances are, the more anxiety and fear you have surrounding women and your sexuality, the more of your own stories and bullshit you’ve bought into. ([Location 2779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2779))
- Typically, the needier you are in a certain area, the more anxiety you’ll have in that area. ([Location 2796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2796))
- Experiencing apathy and avoidance is exactly as it says: it’s when a man convinces himself that he doesn’t care or that it’s not important to him. ([Location 2833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2833))
- Intellectualizing is sometimes beneficial in that you can learn a ton of information about a lot of subjects, and sometimes, the intellectualizing will lead to more self-awareness and help clarify what sort of action you need to take. But there are many men who use intellectualizing as just another form of avoidance. ([Location 2844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2844))
- Intellectualizing also ends up having a backlash. Once you study a subject enough, it can actually increase your anxiety. By studying it so much, you’ve put more pressure on yourself to succeed and, therefore, build up higher expectations for yourself. ([Location 2853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2853))
- The blame game guy will convince himself that it’s her fault. The apathy guy will convince himself that it doesn’t matter. The intellectualizing guy will convince himself that he needs to learn and understand more first. In the end, they're all avoiding what they're afraid of. ([Location 2860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2860))
- Often, stereotypes can be useful. But usually they’re not. Often they’re nothing more than excuses — ways for us to avoid the blame and responsibility for not being satisfied with our results. ([Location 2908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2908))
- I believe strongly in taking responsibility for everything that happens to you in your life. Our minds are always looking for ways to avoid pain and failure and rejection, and so they constantly churn out rationalizations to keep us impeccable; ([Location 2918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2918))
- I was willing to sacrifice the risk of being hurt in order to enjoy the commitment of our relationship. ([Location 2941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2941))
- Challenge yourself to find the good and beautiful thing inside of everyone. It’s there. It’s your job to find it. Not their job to show you. ([Location 2956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2956))
- Actual sex with an actual woman often involves awkward moments of figuring out what she likes, what you like, who likes it which way. It also often involves ecstatic moments of emotional intimacy, something porn can never provide. ([Location 2975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2975))
- Women communicate more in feelings and, more specifically, through intentions. Sure, they still pay attention to the facts and stories on the surface, but what’s actually communicated to them is the intention and feeling underneath. This is sub-communication. ([Location 3270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3270))
- Some dating advice tells men not to compliment a woman too early or too often. The reason for this is that most men who read dating advice have poor intentions: they’re needy and looking to validate themselves through sex or female affection. So when a man compliments a woman out of neediness, it’s going to make a woman feel uncomfortable and objectified. ([Location 3290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3290))
- What you say to her when you first meet her is actually unimportant, ([Location 3584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3584))
- The exact words you say are far less important than your intentions and level of anxiety. ([Location 3586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3586))
- remember, it’s not about entertaining her; it’s about being non-needy and expressing your genuine interest in her. ([Location 3603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3603))
- During the day, I often preface the introduction by saying something like, “Excuse me, this is kind of random...” Also during the day, I usually tell them that I think they’re cute. ([Location 3604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3604))
- Think about it, if you sit around for 10 minutes trying to think of what to say to a girl so that she’ll like you, how is that ever not needy? ([Location 3607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3607))
- Using effective language means saying what you mean with the fewest words possible while still maintaining your meaning and intent. ([Location 3651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3651))
- Instead of incessant questioning, you want to develop a skill called cold reading. ([Location 3678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3678))
- cold reading is just a way of creating interesting statements rather than asking questions for information. You don’t ask the question you want to know, but instead, you make a mild prediction. ([Location 3681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3681))
- Instead of asking her a question about herself, you guess the answer to your question and then state it. ([Location 3683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3683))
- Speaking in statements in this fashion — to generate spontaneous conversation — is important in that it forces you to share yourself with her. When you simply ask a girl questions, you aren’t giving any information about yourself, so it’s harder for her to trust you or build rapport. ([Location 3731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3731))
- Everything you speak about should be, in some way, revealing your identity to her or her identity to you. ([Location 3845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3845))
- Making a connection requires three steps: 1) being open about yourself, 2) getting her to be open about herself, and 3) relating to each other’s experiences. ([Location 3848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3848))
- Take out a sheet of paper and write down three things for each of the following: •    Your passions and favorite things to do. •    Your dreams, ambitions, life goals. •    The best/worst things that have happened to you. •    Your childhood, family life, and upbringing. ([Location 3853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3853))
- Be willing to share any part of yourself to anyone at any time and on any level. You have nothing to lose by sharing yourself. ([Location 3866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3866))
- You want to get her to talk about her passions, her ambitions, her best experiences and her most vulnerable experiences. These are the topics that define us as humans and make us unique — that is, different from the last 20 guys who talked to her. ([Location 3871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3871))
- I’ll give a brief overview of a few types of humor: misdirection, exaggeration, sarcasm, wordplay, and roleplaying. ([Location 3900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3900))
- If you find yourself having a lot of trouble with humor, I recommend watching a lot of stand-up comedians. Some of my favorites are Louis CK, George Carlin, and Bill Hicks. ([Location 3996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3996))
- Good date locations are locations that are active, participatory, and allow for touching and flirting. Alcohol can be helpful as well if that’s your style. Some good examples include comedy clubs, dance classes, museum exhibits, walks in interesting places (plazas, parks, etc.), concerts, or just grabbing a drink somewhere. ([Location 4188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=4188))
- you want your dates to be interactive. You want to be able to walk around, be able to touch and be as interactive as possible. The underlying concept to have on a date is that you should try to constantly be leading. Every decision should be yours and she should be expected to follow it. ([Location 4221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=4221))
- As far as what to talk about, your conversations should be getting deeper and more personal. There should be less teasing and playful banter and more conversations about your lives and what’s important to you. ([Location 4229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=4229))
- In her book, My Secret Garden, the journalist Nancy Friday collected anonymous sexual fantasies from women around the world. If you ever want your mind expanded in an interesting way, check it out. ([Location 4250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=4250))
- the more assertively you pursue a woman, the more aroused she becomes. ([Location 4271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=4271))
- Most men are a bit shy and hesitant when it comes to “making moves:” touching, the first kiss, sexual touching, etc. Well, that needs to stop. From now on, you are a sexually assertive and dominant guy and you have no shame about it. We’ll also discover that women actually prefer you to be this way. ([Location 4297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=4297))
