## Highlights
- in Adlerian psychology, counselling is thought of not as ‘treatment’, but as a place for ‘re-education’. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=393))
- We must be aware of the roles we are playing, whether we are letting education fall into a kind of trap of compulsory ‘intervention’ or limiting ourselves to a self-reliance-stimulating ‘assistance’. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=446))
- Not trying to change or manipulate the other person who is right there in front of you. Accepting that person as he is without setting any conditions. There is no greater respect than this. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=498))
- In this world, no matter how powerful one is, there are two things that cannot be forced. YOUTH: What are they? PHILOSOPHER: ‘Respect’ and ‘love’. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=517))
- To get away from one’s attachment to oneself, and to have concern for other people. If one progresses in accordance with these guidelines, one arrives at ‘social feeling’ as a matter of course. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=588))
- ‘Seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another and feeling with the heart of another.’ ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=619))
- ‘What if I had the same kind of heart and life as this person?’ ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=634))
- ‘What if I had the same heart as him? What if I had the same life as him?’ ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=640))
- The past is not something that cannot be regained. Rather, it simply and purely does not exist. Until one takes it that far, one cannot get any closer to the essence of teleology. ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=772))
- No matter how much you seek agreement regarding ‘that bad person’ or complain about ‘poor me’, and whether there is someone who listens to that, even if you derive some temporary comfort, it will not lead to a true solution. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=843))
- That is why, in Adlerian psychology, we talk to each other about ‘What should one do from now on?’ ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=866))
- the past does not exist. The past you speak of is nothing more than a story skilfully compiled by ‘you now’. ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=870))
- rules that have been created through a democratic process. ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=909))
- An organisation in which someone is using their power to suppress has irrationality at its foundation. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=922))
- The thing is, the moment that a person realises his longing for love will not be fulfilled, he does an about-face and begins to look for hate. ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1124))
- By engaging in harm to oneself and injury to one’s worth, one accuses the other, saying, ‘It’s your fault I’ve ended up this way.’ ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1149))
- Adler advises that we ‘renounce the standpoint of the judge’. You have not been granted the privilege of passing down judgements. Maintaining law and order is not your job. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1351))
- Violence, which includes reprimand, is a form of communication that reveals one’s immaturity as a human being. ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1358))
- ‘Man’s juvenile condition is not due to lack of reason. It is that he has neither the resolution nor the courage to use his reason without direction from another. ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1390))
- It is easier to live according to ‘direction from another’. One does not have to think about difficult things, and one does not have to take responsibility for failure. ([Location 1402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1402))
- Moreover, in order to keep children in a juvenile condition, the adults around them use every conceivable means to indoctrinate children regarding the dangers and risks and scariness of self-reliance. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1406))
- parents, and then educators, engage in excessive meddling and nurturing of their children. As a result, they end up raising children who cannot decide anything on their own, and who need constant direction from others. ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1414))
- leaders charged with the management of organisations as well, must always uphold the objective of self-reliance. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1432))
- the essence of happiness is the feeling of contribution. ([Location 1450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1450))
- You, who are not in the position of receiving the final responsibility, must not intervene in others’ tasks. ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1471))
- ‘One can choose one’s own life.’ ([Location 1475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1475))
- One is always concerned with how to be praised first and more frequently than everyone else. ([Location 1568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1568))
- Put the other way around, nothing is scarier to humans than isolation. ([Location 1718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1718))
- As a consequence, we are always longing for a strong connection with other people. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1719))
- All people have community feeling inside them inherently. ([Location 1722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1722))
- spending one’s days in competition with one’s comrades is against the principles of nature. ([Location 1730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1730))
- In Adlerian psychology, a human being’s most fundamental need is the sense of belonging. In a word, we do not want to be isolated. ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1747))
- Instead of seeking approval, one has to approve oneself, with one’s own mind. ([Location 1766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1766))
- It’s okay to be just as we are. Your place to be is there, without needing to be a special being or be outstanding in any way. Let’s accept our ordinary selves, ourselves as everyone else. ([Location 1772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1772))
- Look, instead of placing worth on being different from people, place worth on being yourself. That is true individuality. ([Location 1785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1785))
- First of all, one must not rebuke children. Because rebuking is conduct that damages each other’s respect. ([Location 1855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1855))
- Praising gives rise to the principle of competition within the community and implants in the child a lifestyle, or worldview, of ‘other people are my enemies’. ([Location 1858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1858))
- They want the child to stay a child forever. ([Location 1863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1863))
- Self-reliance is one’s own determining of one’s worth. ([Location 1870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1870))
- a messiah complex. It is a mental perversion of wanting to be a messiah, a saviour of others. ([Location 1893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=1893))
- Is it all right to just stay away from other people and shut oneself up in one’s room? ([Location 2021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2021))
- ‘All joy is interpersonal relationship joy.’ ([Location 2025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2025))
- ‘In friendship, we see with the eyes of another, listen with the ears of another and feel with the heart of another.’ ([Location 2030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2030))
- Earlier, I spoke of community feeling as a feeling that resides within all people. It is not something one strives to gain, but something one digs up from within oneself. ([Location 2035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2035))
- Division of labour is the incomparable survival strategy that the human race acquired in order to compensate for its physical inferiority. This is Adler’s final conclusion. ([Location 2126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2126))
- it is only upon having pursued self-interestedness that one finds contribution to others. ([Location 2197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2197))
- a person’s worth is not something that is decided by what kind of work they engage in. It is decided by the attitude with which they undertake that work. ([Location 2206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2206))
- all other work is something that has to been done by someone in the community, and no superior or inferior can exist there. If anyone is going to be superior or inferior, it will only be in the attitude with which they undertake that work. ([Location 2212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2212))
- It would seem that it is dangerous to overestimate ‘rightness’. ([Location 2391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2391))
- YOUTH: Then, how can one gain a true sense of belonging? PHILOSOPHER: One has confidence in other people, and one embarks on friend relationships. That is the only way. We cannot gain happiness solely by dedicating ourselves to our work. ([Location 2437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2437))
- ‘Give, and it shall be given unto you.’ ([Location 2539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2539))
- One must not wait to have something given to one. ([Location 2541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2541))
- all we hear about is conceptual ‘divine love’ and instinctive ‘animal love’, and no one even attempts to speak of ‘human love’. ([Location 2576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2576))
- Love that is just ‘falling’, anyone can do. Such a thing is not worthy of being called a life task. ([Location 2601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2601))
- The falling in love you speak of is no different from this desire to possess or this desire for triumph. ([Location 2624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2624))
- ‘Happiness is the feeling of contribution.’ ([Location 2711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2711))
- In other words, it is by pursuing ‘my happiness’ that we build division of labour relationships and by pursuing ‘your happiness’ that we build friend relationships. ([Location 2733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2733))
- Rather than the self-interested seeking of ‘my happiness’ or the other-interested wishing for ‘your happiness’, it is the building of a happiness of an inseparable ‘us’. That is love. ([Location 2740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2740))
- One upholds ‘us’ as being higher than ‘me’ or ‘you’. ([Location 2743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2743))
- When one knows real love, however, the subject of life changes from ‘me’ to ‘us’. ([Location 2754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2754))
- Weakness becomes a frightfully powerful weapon in an interpersonal relationship. ([Location 2770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2770))
- There are many adults who treat their own weakness or misfortune, their hurt, troubled background and trauma, as a weapon and plot how they will control other people. ([Location 2786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2786))
- Adler referred to such adults as ‘pampered children’ and was very critical of their lifestyle and worldview. ([Location 2788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2788))
- Self-reliance is ‘breaking away from self-centredness’. ([Location 2807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2807))
- It is through love that we are liberated from ‘me’, that we achieve self-reliance and truly accept the world. ([Location 2814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2814))
- The ‘us’ that began as just two people will eventually broaden in scope to the entire community and the entire human race. ([Location 2817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2817))
- We are alive here and now because we had the love of our mothers and fathers and because there was devotion. The person who thinks, ‘I was raised without love from anyone,’ must not turn away from this fact. ([Location 2835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2835))
- When we choose our lifestyle, its objective can only be to find out ‘How I can be loved.’ We all choose a ‘lifestyle for being loved’ as a survival strategy that is directly linked to our lives. ([Location 2848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2848))
- Because it is through loving others that we at last become adults. ([Location 2878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2878))
- Limitless love so often transforms into a tool for controlling the child. All parents must uphold the clear objective of self-reliance and go about building equal relationships with their children. ([Location 2941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2941))
- We choose our lifestyle at a time when we can only crave to be loved by our parents. ([Location 2958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2958))
- To get out from under the control of the love one is given, the only thing one can do is have one’s own love. ([Location 2960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2960))
- This is a condition in which one has secured some guarantee of being loved, even if it is all one’s own misunderstanding. One feels some kind of collateral there: ‘That person probably likes me,’ or ‘They probably won’t reject my goodwill.’ And it is on the basis of that collateral that we can begin to love more deeply. ([Location 2973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2973))
- One loves regardless of what the other person thinks of one. One throws oneself into love. ([Location 2977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2977))
- You do not love yourself yet. You are not able to respect yourself or have confidence in yourself. That is why you end up assuming that in a love relationship, you will definitely get hurt or definitely feel miserable. Because you think that there couldn’t be anyone who could love someone like you. ([Location 2984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2984))
- Loving is your task. But how will the other person respond to your love? That is the other person’s task and is not something you can control. What you can do is separate the tasks, and just love first, from yourself. ([Location 2991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2991))
- You must take a straight look at the childhood lifestyle you have been carrying in secret, and make a new start. Don’t wait for someone who will love you to appear. ([Location 3005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3005))
- to grow that modest meeting into some kind of relationship requires a certain courage. To call out to people and send letters and such. ([Location 3037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3037))
- So, what does a person do when they lose the courage to embark on a relationship? They cling to fantasies of a destined one ([Location 3040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3040))
- Marriage is not a matter of choosing a target. It is a matter of choosing one’s way of living. ([Location 3057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3057))
- Of course, there are many people who felt destiny on meeting someone and decided to get married in accordance with that intuition. ([Location 3066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3066))
- ‘Loving someone is not simply an intense emotion. It is a decision, it is a judgement, it is a promise.’ ([Location 3068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3068))
- Destiny in that case is not a predetermined thing. Nor is it something that has rained down upon one by chance. It should be something that has been built up by the effort of two people. ([Location 3077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3077))
- One dances. Without thinking about a future one could never comprehend, or about a destiny that could never exist, one simply engages in a dance of the now with the partner before one. ([Location 3084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3084))
- People will speak of the tracks of the long dance you two have created as destiny. ([Location 3089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3089))
- There is one thing that you should do. Take the hand of the person beside you, and try to do the best dance that you can possibly do in that moment. Your destiny will start from there. ([Location 3095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3095))
- how did you resolve to get married to this person and no one else? ([Location 3112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3112))
- The responsibility one must take on is great, and painful things and unforeseeable hardships may lie ahead. Is one still capable of loving, in the face of that? Does one have the resolve, no matter what troubles arise, to love this person and walk beside them? Can one make that feeling into a promise? ([Location 3122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3122))
- It is not that you didn’t love her. You didn’t know what ‘loving’ was. If you had known, I am sure you would have been able to build a relationship of destiny with that woman. ([Location 3132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3132))
- ‘Love is an act of faith, and whoever is of little faith is also of little love.’ ([Location 3135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3135))
- You were of little courage. So, you were able to love only a little. Not possessing the courage to love, you tried to stay in the lifestyle of your childhood, the lifestyle of being loved. ([Location 3136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3136))
- It is only by loving another person that we are liberated from self-centredness. It is only by loving another person that we can achieve self-reliance. And it is only by loving another person that we arrive at community feeling. ([Location 3146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3146))
- The issue here is one’s method for gaining a feeling of contribution, or, rather, one’s way of living. ([Location 3150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3150))
- ‘Love, be self-reliant and choose life.’ ([Location 3159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3159))
- That the world is simple, and life is too. But also, that ‘Keeping it simple is difficult.’ It is there that the passage of nothing days become one’s trial. ([Location 3177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3177))
- And as our time is limited, all our interpersonal relationships come into being on the premise of our parting. ([Location 3199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3199))
- the reality is that we meet in order to part. ([Location 3200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3200))
- there is one thing we can do. It is to devote our ceaseless efforts, in all our meetings and all our interpersonal relationships, towards the best possible parting. ([Location 3202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3202))
- ‘Meeting this person, and passing the time together with this person, was not a mistake.’ ([Location 3205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3205))
- Then, you have no choice but to start building now the kind of relationship that would make you feel that way. That is what is meant by ‘Live earnestly here and now.’ ([Location 3210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3210))
- We should have no regrets about our time together. ([Location 3225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3225))
- It is your independence, your self-reliance, as a lover of wisdom, that is to say, as a philosopher. Didn’t I say it three years ago? That the answers should not be something you get from someone else, but something you arrive at on your own. You are ready to do that. ([Location 3230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3230))
