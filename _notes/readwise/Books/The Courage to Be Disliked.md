## Highlights
- If we focus only on past causes and try to explain things solely through cause and effect, we end up with ‘determinism’. Because what this says is that our present and our future have already been decided by past occurrences, and are unalterable. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=237))
- in Adlerian psychology, we do not think about past ‘causes’, but rather about present ‘goals’. ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=244))
- ‘aetiology’ (the study of causation) and teleology (the study of the purpose of a given phenomenon, rather than its cause). ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=254))
- those who take an aetiological stance, including most counsellors and psychiatrists, would argue that what you were suffering from stemmed from such-and-such cause in the past, and would then end up just consoling you by saying, ‘So you see, it’s not your fault.’ ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=264))
- In Adlerian psychology, trauma is definitively denied. This was a very new and revolutionary point. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=270))
- We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.’ ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=274))
- He is not saying that the experience of a horrible calamity or abuse during childhood or other such incidents have no influence on forming a personality; their influences are strong. But the important thing is that nothing is actually determined by those influences. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=277))
- Your life is not something that someone gives you, but something you choose yourself, and you are the one who decides how you live. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=280))

- PHILOSOPHER: If I stay in my room all the time, without ever going out, my parents will worry. I can get all of my parents’ attention focused on me. They’ll be extremely careful around me, and always handle me with kid gloves. On the other hand, if I take even one step out of the house, I’ll just become part of a faceless mass who no one pays attention to. I’ll be surrounded by people I don’t know, and just end up average, or less than average. And no one will take special care of me any longer … Such stories about reclusive people are not uncommon. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=292))
    - Note: People want to feel special. So they create conditions that will make others treat them differently.
- You did not fly into a rage and then start shouting. It is solely that you got angry so that you could shout. In other words, in order to fulfil the goal of shouting, you created the emotion of anger. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=319))
- The procedure of explaining things in normal words felt like too much trouble, and you tried to get out of that and make this unresisting person submit to you. The tool you used to do this was the emotion of anger. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=328))
- If the past determined everything and couldn’t be changed, we who are living today would no longer be able to take effective steps forward in our lives. What would happen as a result? We would end up with the kind of nihilism and pessimism that loses hope in the world and gives up on life. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=361))
- it is Freudian aetiology that denies our free will, and treats humans like machines. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=368))
- You should arrive at answers on your own, and not rely upon what you get from someone else. Answers from others are nothing more than stopgap measures; they’re of no value. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=385))
- YOUTH: So, Socrates and Adler both conveyed their ideas by dialogue? PHILOSOPHER: That’s right. All your doubts will be dispelled through this dialogue. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=389))
- You think you’d be happier if you were like him. Which means that you are not happy now, right? ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=411))
- Right now, you are unable to feel really happy. This is because you have not learned to love yourself. And to try to love yourself, you are wishing to be reborn as a different person. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=412))
- Look, no matter how much you want to be Y, you cannot be reborn as him. You are not Y. It’s okay for you to be you. However, I am not saying it’s fine to be ‘just as you are’. If you are unable to really feel happy, then it’s clear that things aren’t right just as they are. You’ve got to put one foot in front of the other, and not stop. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=421))
- ‘The important thing is not what one is born with, but what use one makes of that equipment.’ ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=425))
- You find living hard, and even wish you could be reborn as a different person. But you are unhappy now because you yourself chose ‘being unhappy’. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=438))
- The Greek word for ‘good’ (agathon) does not have a moral meaning. It just means ‘beneficial’. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=449))
- yet there is not one person who desires evil in the purest sense of the word; that is to say something ‘not beneficial’. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=451))
- At some stage in your life, you chose ‘being unhappy’. It is not because you were born into unhappy circumstances or ended up in an unhappy situation. It’s that you judged ‘being unhappy’ to be good for you. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=453))
- In Adlerian psychology, we describe personality and disposition with the word ‘lifestyle’. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=465))
- Lifestyle is the tendencies of thought and action in life. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=467))
- lifestyle could be defined as someone’s personality; taken more broadly, it is a word that encompasses the worldview of that person and their outlook on life. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=469))
- Say there’s someone who worries about himself and says, ‘I am a pessimist.’ One could rephrase that to instead say, ‘I have a pessimistic view of the world.’ You could consider that the issue is not personality, but rather the view of the world. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=471))
- the word ‘personality’ is nuanced, and suggests being unchangeable. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=473))
- In Adlerian psychology, however, lifestyle is thought of as something that you choose for yourself. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=477))
- Of course, you did not consciously choose ‘this kind of self’. Your first choice was probably unconscious, combined with external factors you have referred to; that is, race, nationality, culture, and home environment. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=484))
- Adlerian psychology’s view is that it happens around the age of ten. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=488))
- If your lifestyle is not something that you were naturally born with, but something you chose yourself, then it must be possible to choose it over again. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=491))
- Whether you go on choosing the lifestyle you’ve had up till now, or you choose a new lifestyle altogether, it’s entirely up to you. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=498))
- People can change at any time, regardless of the environments they are in. You are only unable to change because you are making the decision not to. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=501))
- you probably think that the lifestyle you have now is the most practical one, and that it’s just easier to leave things as they are. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=508))
- if one chooses a new lifestyle, no one can predict what might happen to the new self, or have any idea how to deal with events as they arise. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=511))
- Simply put, people have various complaints about things, but it’s easier and more secure to be just the way one is. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=513))
- When we try to change our lifestyles, we put our great courage to the test. There is the anxiety generated by changing, and the disappointment attendant to not changing. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=515))
- One might say you are lacking in the courage to be happy. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=519))
- What you should do now is make a decision to stop your current lifestyle. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=534))
- As long as you live that way, in the realm of the possibility of ‘if only such and such were the case’, you will never be able to change. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=535))
- saying ‘if only I could be like Y’ is an excuse to yourself for not changing. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=536))
- He doesn’t want to expose his work to criticism, and he certainly doesn’t want to face the reality that he might produce an inferior piece of writing and face rejection. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=540))
- If he did, he might grow, or discover that he should pursue something different. Either way, he would be able to move on. That is what changing your current lifestyle is about. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=546))
- if you change your lifestyle—the way of giving meaning to the world and yourself—then, both your way of interacting with the world and your behaviour will have to change as well. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=553))
- You, just as you are, have to choose your lifestyle. It might seem hard, but it is really quite simple. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=555))
- ‘No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on.’ ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=559))
- the past does not exist. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=561))
- You’re wrong. You notice only your shortcomings because you’ve resolved to not start liking yourself. In order to not like yourself, you don’t see your strong points, and focus only on your shortcomings. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=588))
- she fabricated that fear of blushing as an excuse for her own inability to confess her feelings. Or maybe as a kind of insurance for when he rejected her. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=616))
- Why do you focus only on your shortcomings, and why have you decided to not start liking yourself? It’s because you are overly afraid of being disliked by other people and getting hurt in your interpersonal relationships. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=645))
- In other words, your goal is to not get hurt in your relationships with other people. ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=650))
- But don’t forget, it’s basically impossible to not get hurt in your relations with other people. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=660))
- ‘All problems are interpersonal relationship problems.’ ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=676))
- You’ve avoided interpersonal relationships by disliking yourself. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=695))
- ‘feeling of inferiority’ is a term that has to do with one’s value judgement of oneself. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=712))
- the feelings of inferiority we’re suffering from are subjective interpretations rather than objective facts? ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=737))
- there is one good thing about subjectivity: it allows you to make your own choice. ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=740))
- First of all, people enter this world as helpless beings. And people have the universal desire to escape from that helpless state. Adler called this the ‘pursuit of superiority’. ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=766))
- Adler is saying that the pursuit of superiority and the feeling of inferiority are not diseases, but stimulants to normal, healthy striving and growth. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=776))
- For instance, if one had a feeling of inferiority with regard to one’s education, and resolved to oneself, I’m not well educated, so I’ll just have to try harder than anyone else, that would be a desirable direction. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=797))
- It’s simply that it’s scary to take even one step forward; also, that you don’t want to make realistic efforts. You don’t want to change so much that you’d be willing to sacrifice the pleasures you enjoy now—for instance, the time you spend playing and engaged in hobbies. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=816))
- you’re not equipped with the courage to change your lifestyle. It’s easier with things just as they are now, even if you have some complaints or limitations. ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=818))
- One can’t accept ‘one’s incapable self’. At that point, the person thinks of trying to compensate in some other fashion, and looks for an easier way out. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=843))
- ‘The one who boasts does so only out of a feeling of inferiority.’ ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=865))
- If one really has confidence in oneself, one doesn’t feel the need to boast. It’s because one’s feeling of inferiority is strong that one boasts. One feels the need to flaunt one’s superiority all the more. ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=867))
- a pattern leading to a particular feeling of superiority that manifests due to the feeling of inferiority itself becoming intensified. Concretely speaking, it’s bragging about one’s own misfortune. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=872))
- If someone should try to comfort this person, or suggest some change be made, he’ll refuse the helping hand by saying, ‘You don’t understand how I feel.’ ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=876))
- Such people try to make themselves ‘special’ by way of their experience of misfortune, ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=878))
- I’m sure that everyone around me would start treating me just as if I were a boil about to burst, and would handle me very carefully—or, ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=882))
- They use their misfortune to their advantage, and try to control the other party with it. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=887))
- ‘In our culture weakness can be quite strong and powerful.’ ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=890))
- The pursuit of superiority is the mindset of taking a single step forward on one’s own feet, not the mindset of competition of the sort that necessitates aiming to be greater than other people. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=912))
- It’s enough to just keep moving in a forward direction, without competing with anyone. And, of course, there is no need to compare oneself with others. ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=915))
- A healthy feeling of inferiority is not something that comes from comparing oneself to others, but from one’s comparison with one’s ideal self. ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=918))
- Let’s acknowledge in a positive manner the fact that other people are different from us. And that we are not the same, but we are equal. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=920))
- No, instead of treating the child like an adult, or like a child, one must treat them like a human being. One interacts with the child with sincerity, as another human being just like oneself. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=931))
- It is in trying to progress past who one is now that there is value. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=936))
- I withdrew from places that are preoccupied with winning and losing. When one is trying to be oneself, competition will inevitably get in the way. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=941))
- If there is competition at the core of a person’s interpersonal relationships, he will not be able to escape interpersonal relationship problems or escape misfortune. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=952))
- When one is conscious of competition and victory and defeat, it is inevitable that feelings of inferiority will arise. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=960))
- Now, what kind of being do you think the other person is to you, at that point? ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=962))
- You start to think that people are always looking down on you and treating you with scorn; ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=965))
- In short, that the world is a terrifying place. ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=967))
    - Note: When you start to think of everyone as a competition, the world becomes a terrifying place.
- The reason that so many people don’t really feel happy while they’re building up their success in the eyes of society is that they are living in competition. Because to them, the world is a perilous place that is overflowing with enemies. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=971))
- ‘You’re the only one who’s worried how you look.’ ([Location 976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=976))
- Earlier, didn’t you say, ‘I can’t celebrate other people’s happiness with all my heart’? ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=996))
- However, once one is released from the schema of competition, the need to triumph over someone disappears. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=998))
- And once the interpersonal relationship reaches the revenge stage, it is almost impossible for either party to find a solution. ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1066))
- When you are challenged to a fight, and you sense that it is a power struggle, step down from the conflict as soon as possible. Do not answer his action with a reaction. That is the only thing we can do. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1072))
- anger is a form of communication, and that communication is nevertheless possible without using anger. ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1077))
- Irascible people do not have short tempers—it is only that they do not know that there are effective communication tools other than anger. ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1082))
- One more thing about power struggles. In every instance, no matter how much you might think you are right, try not to criticise the other party on that basis. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1087))
- The moment one is convinced that ‘I am right’ in an interpersonal relationship, one has already stepped into a power struggle. ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1090))
- I am right. That is to say, the other party is wrong. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1092))
- Because of one’s mindset of not wanting to lose, one is unable to admit one’s mistake, ([Location 1100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1100))
- Admitting mistakes, conveying words of apology, and stepping down from power struggles—none of these things is defeat. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1101))
- you have lost your courage and you are running away from your ‘life tasks’. ([Location 1115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1115))
- First, there are two objectives for behaviour: to be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society. ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1119))
- I have the ability and the consciousness that people are my comrades. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1120))
- Adler made three categories of the interpersonal relationships that arise out of these processes. He referred to them as ‘tasks of work’, ‘tasks of friendship’ and ‘tasks of love’, and all together as ‘life tasks’. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1132))
- There’s no value at all in the number of friends or acquaintances you have. ([Location 1178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1178))
- Instead of waiting for others to change or waiting for the situation to change, you take the first step forward yourself. ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1182))
- Adler does not accept restricting one’s partner. If the person seems to be happy, one can frankly celebrate that condition. That is love. ([Location 1194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1194))
- relationship that feels somehow oppressive and strained when the two people are together cannot be called love, even if there is passion. ([Location 1198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1198))
- Whenever I am with this person, I can behave very freely, one can really feel love. ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1199))
- ‘If two people want to live together on good terms, they must treat each other as equal personalities.’ ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1203))
- No matter how distressful the relationship, you must not avoid or put off dealing with it. ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1209))
- You said that I see other people as enemies and can’t think of them as comrades, because I’m running away from my life tasks. ([Location 1218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1218))
- You had the goal of taking a dislike to Mr A beforehand, and then started looking for the flaws to satisfy that goal. ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1222))
- One is running away from one’s life tasks by saying that everything is the fault of other people, or the fault of one’s environment. ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1241))
- There is no need to be recognised by others. Actually, one must not seek recognition. This point cannot be overstated. ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1340))
- Adler was very critical of education by reward and punishment. It leads to mistaken lifestyles in which people think, If no one is going to praise me, I won’t take appropriate action and If no one is going to punish me, I’ll engage in inappropriate actions, too. ([Location 1359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1359))
- And please remember this: if you are not living to satisfy other people’s expectations, it follows that other people are not living to satisfy your expectations. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1378))
- In general, all interpersonal relationship troubles are caused by intruding on other people’s tasks, or having one’s own tasks intruded on. ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1429))
- Think, Who ultimately is going to receive the end result brought about by the choice that is made? ([Location 1434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1434))
- One has to pay attention. Adlerian psychology does not recommend the non-interference approach. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1445))
- ‘You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.’ ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1455))
- You are the only one who can change yourself. ([Location 1459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1459))
- the most important thing is whether the child feels he can consult frankly with his parents when he is experiencing a dilemma, ([Location 1465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1465))
- I would send a message to him to the effect that I am ready to assist him whenever he is in need. ([Location 1469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1469))
- the parent is taking on the child’s task as his or her own, and is no longer able to think about anything but the child. When at last the parent notices it, the ‘I’ is already gone from his or her life. ([Location 1474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1474))
- with families there is less distance, so it’s all the more necessary to consciously separate the tasks. ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1481))
- Supposing your partner did not act as you had wished. Would you still be able to believe in that person? Would you still be able to love that person? The task of love that Adler speaks of is comprised of such questions. ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1486))
- If you are leading a life of worry and suffering—which ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1490))
- first, learn the boundary of ‘from here on, that is not my task’. And discard other people’s tasks. That is the first step toward lightening the load and making life simpler. ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1491))
- All you can do with regard to your own life is choose the best path that you believe in. ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1504))
- On the other hand, what kind of judgement do other people pass on that choice? That is the task of other people, and is not a matter you can do anything about. ([Location 1505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1505))
- You are worried about being judged by other people. That is why you are constantly craving recognition from others. ([Location 1508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1508))
- First, one should ask ‘whose task is this?’ Then do the separation of tasks. Calmly delineate up to what point one’s own tasks go, and from what point they become another person’s tasks. And do not intervene in other people’s tasks, or allow even a single person to intervene in one’s own tasks. ([Location 1536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1536))
- Parents who scold their children too much become mentally very distant. When this happens, the child can no longer even consult the parents, and the parents can no longer give the proper assistance. ([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1575))
- It’s the idea that when another person does something for you, you have to do something in return—even if that person does not want anything. ([Location 1580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1580))
- We must not seek reward, and we must not be tied to it. ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1585))
- there are certainly situations in which it would be easier to intervene in the tasks of another person without doing any separation of tasks. ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1586))
- ‘Children who have not been taught to confront challenges will try to avoid all challenges.’ ([Location 1590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1590))
- Living as one likes, on the other hand, is extremely difficult. What does one want? What does one want to become, and what kind of life does one want to lead? ([Location 1615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1615))
- one’s way as long as one stays on those rails. But if one is deciding one’s path oneself, it’s only natural that one will get lost at times. One comes up against the wall of ‘how one should live’. ([Location 1619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1619))
- Does one choose recognition from others, or does one choose a path of freedom without recognition? It’s an important question—let’s ([Location 1626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1626))
- But look at it this way: what should one do to not be disliked by anyone? There is only one answer: it is to constantly gauge other people’s feelings, ([Location 1632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1632))
- If one is living in a such a way as to satisfy other people’s expectations, and one is entrusting one’s own life to others, that is a way of living in which one is lying to oneself, and continuing that lying to include the people around one. ([Location 1637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1637))
- Separating one’s tasks is not an egocentric thing. Intervening in other people’s tasks is essentially an egocentric way of thinking, however. ([Location 1641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1641))
- An adult, who has chosen an unfree way to live, on seeing a young person living freely here and now in this moment, criticises the youth as being hedonistic; ([Location 1646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1646))
- An adult who has chosen real freedom himself will not make such comments, and will instead cheer on the will to be free. ([Location 1648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1648))
- Not wanting to be disliked by other people. To human beings, this is an entirely natural desire, and an impulse. Kant, the giant of modern philosophy, called this desire ‘inclination’. ([Location 1661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1661))
- ‘freedom is being disliked by other people’. ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1677))
- It’s that you are disliked by someone. It is proof that you are exercising your freedom and living in freedom, ([Location 1678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1678))
- Unless one is unconcerned by other people’s judgements, has no fear of being disliked by other people, and pays the cost that one might never be recognised, one will never be able to follow through in one’s own way of living. That is to say, one will not be able to be free. ([Location 1687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1687))
- ‘Not wanting to be disliked’ is probably my task, but whether or not so-and-so dislikes me is the other person’s task. ([Location 1704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1704))
- In Adlerian psychology, physical symptoms are not regarded separately from the mind (psyche). ([Location 1793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1793))
- Interpersonal relations are the source of unhappiness. And the opposite can be said, too—interpersonal relations are the source of happiness. ([Location 1854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1854))
- People who are incapable of carrying out the separation of tasks, and who are obsessed with the desire for recognition are also extremely self-centred. ([Location 1877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1877))
- People who are obsessed with such a desire for recognition will seem to be looking at other people, while they are actually only looking at themselves. They lack concern for others, and are concerned solely with the ‘I’. Simply put, they are self-centred. ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1880))
- all people who are attached to the ‘I’ are self-centred. And that is precisely why it is necessary to make the switch from ‘attachment to self’ to ‘concern for others’. ([Location 1891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1891))
- Feeling that one has one’s own place of refuge within the community; feeling that ‘it’s okay to be here’, and having a sense of belonging—these are basic human desires. ([Location 1899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1899))
- While the ‘I’ is life’s protagonist, it is never more than a member of the community and a part of the whole. ([Location 1903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1903))
- In Adlerian psychology, however, a sense of belonging is something that one can attain only by making an active commitment to the community ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1931))
- One faces one’s life tasks. ([Location 1934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1934))
- One needs to think not What will this person give me? but, rather, What can I give to this person? ([Location 1938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1938))
- A sense of belonging is something that one acquires through one’s own efforts—it is not something one is endowed with at birth. ([Location 1941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1941))
- Abruptly cut off from the company that was his community and bereft of title or profession, he becomes an ‘ordinary nobody’. As he is unable to accept the fact that he is now ‘normal’, he becomes old practically overnight. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=1956))
- When we run into difficulties in our interpersonal relations, or when we can no longer see a way out, what we should consider first and foremost is the principle that says ‘listen to the voice of the larger community’. ([Location 2002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2002))
- Though this might be termed a ‘you and I’ relationship, if it is one that can break down just because you raise an objection, then it is not the sort of relationship you need to get into in the first place. It is fine to just let go of it. Living in fear of one’s relationships falling apart is an unfree way to live, in which one is living for other people. ([Location 2011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2011))
- Do not cling to the small community right in front of you. There will always be more ‘you and I’, and more ‘everyone’, and larger communities that exist. ([Location 2015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2015))
- generally speaking there are two approaches that are considered: one is the method of raising by rebuke, and the other is the method of raising by praise. ([Location 2028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2028))
- Which one do you think is the better choice? To rebuke or to praise? ([Location 2030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2030))
- One must not praise, and one must not rebuke. That is the standpoint of Adlerian psychology. ([Location 2041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2041))
- In the act of praise, there is the aspect of it being ‘the passing of judgement by a person of ability on a person of no ability’. ([Location 2047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2047))
- When one person praises another, the goal is ‘to manipulate someone who has less ability than you’. It is not done out of gratitude or respect. ([Location 2053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2053))
- Adlerian psychology refutes all manner of vertical relationships, and proposes that all interpersonal relationships be horizontal relationships. ([Location 2064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2064))
- If one can build horizontal relationships that are ‘equal but not the same’ for all people, there will no longer be any room for inferiority complexes to emerge. ([Location 2077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2077))
- When one is not following through with one’s tasks, it is not because one is without ability. Adlerian psychology tells us that the issue here is not one of ability, but simply that ‘one has lost the courage to face one’s tasks’. ([Location 2110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2110))
- The more one is praised by another person, the more one forms the belief that one has no ability. ([Location 2118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2118))
- If one is able to feel one has worth, then one can accept oneself just as one is and have the courage to face one’s life tasks. ([Location 2152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2152))
- how on earth can one become able to feel one has worth? ([Location 2153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2153))
- It is about having concern for others, building horizontal relationships and taking the approach of encouragement. ([Location 2162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2162))
- So, let’s look at other people not on the ‘level of acts’, but on the ‘level of being’. ([Location 2188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2188))
- If you consider things at the level of being, we are of use to others and have worth just by being here. ([Location 2191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2191))
- instead of thinking of oneself on the level of acts, first of all one accepts oneself on the level of being. ([Location 2202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2202))
- First of all, build a horizontal relationship between yourself and another person. One is enough. Let’s start from there. ([Location 2239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2239))
- On the other hand, if one has managed to build a horizontal relationship with at least one person—if one has been able to build a relationship of equals in the true sense of the term—that is a major lifestyle transformation. With that breakthrough, all one’s interpersonal relations will gradually become horizontal. ([Location 2253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2253))
- Rather, what is important is to be equal in consciousness, and to assert that which needs to be asserted. ([Location 2262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2262))
- You are just thinking there is no space to refuse so that you can avoid the conflict of the associated interpersonal relations and avoid responsibility—and ([Location 2272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2272))
- Age does not matter in love and friendship. ([Location 2283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2283))
- And you stay away from the kind of interpersonal relationship in which you would just be yourself. But I’ll bet that when you’re home alone, you sing out loud and dance to music, and speak in a lively voice. ([Location 2345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2345))
- Three things are needed at this point: ‘self-acceptance’, ‘confidence in others’ and ‘contribution to others’. ([Location 2353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2353))
- ‘The important thing is not what one is born with, but what use one makes of that equipment.’ ([Location 2356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2356))
- Self-affirmation is making suggestions to oneself, such as ‘I can do it’ or ‘I am strong’, even when something is simply beyond one’s ability. ([Location 2363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2363))
- With self-acceptance, on the other hand, if one cannot do something, one is simply accepting ‘one’s incapable self’ as is, and moving forward so that one can do whatever one can. It is not a way of lying to oneself. ([Location 2365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2365))
- there is no such thing as a one hundred per cent person. This is something we should actively acknowledge. ([Location 2372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2372))
- One cannot change what one is born with. But one can, under one’s own power, go about changing what use one makes of that equipment. ([Location 2376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2376))
- one simply has to focus on what one can change, rather than on what one cannot. This is what I call self-acceptance. ([Location 2378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2378))
- When one is switching from attachment to self to concern for others, the second key concept—confidence in others—becomes absolutely essential. ([Location 2393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2393))
- there will be times when one gets taken advantage of. ([Location 2407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2407))
- The attitude of continuing to believe in someone even in such instances is what we call confidence. ([Location 2408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2408))
- Would you be able to betray such a person again and again? ([Location 2414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2414))
- you live your life doubting other people—doubting your friends, and even your family and those you love. What sort of relationship could possibly arise from that? ([Location 2421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2421))
- It is precisely because we lay a foundation of unconditional confidence that it is possible for us to build a deep relationship. ([Location 2423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2423))
- if you are afraid to have confidence in others, in the long run, you will not be able to build deep relationships with anyone. ([Location 2451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2451))
- If one can simply accept oneself as one is, and ascertain what one can do and what one cannot, one becomes able to understand that ‘taking advantage’ is the other person’s task, and getting to the core of ‘confidence in others’ becomes less difficult. ([Location 2459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2459))
- When one is sad, one should be sad to one’s heart’s content. It is precisely when one tries to escape the pain and sadness that one gets stuck and ceases to be able to build deep relationships with anyone. ([Location 2464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2464))
- Contribution to others does not connote self-sacrifice. ([Location 2487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2487))
- we are truly aware of our own worth only when we feel that our existence and behaviour are beneficial to the community, ([Location 2488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2488))
- Labour is not a means of earning money. It is through labour that one makes contributions to others and commits to one’s community, and that one truly feels ‘I am of use to someone’ ([Location 2500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2500))
- words, ‘to be self-reliant’ and ‘the consciousness that I have the ability’ corresponds to our discussion of self-acceptance. ([Location 2543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2543))
- ‘to live in harmony with society’ and ‘the consciousness that people are my comrades’ connects to confidence in others, and then to contribution to others. ([Location 2544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2544))
- The view in Adlerian psychology is that people who suffer from stammering are concerned only about their own way of speaking, and they have feelings of inferiority and see their lives as unbearably hard. ([Location 2582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2582))
- ‘It’s busy at work, so I don’t have enough time to think about my family.’ But this is a life-lie. ([Location 2603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2603))
- They are simply trying to avoid their other responsibilities by using work as an excuse. One ought to concern oneself with everything, from household chores and childrearing, to one’s friendships and hobbies and so on; ([Location 2604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2604))
- Does one accept oneself on the level of acts, or on the level of being? This is truly a question that relates to the courage to be happy. ([Location 2623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2623))
- that the feeling of ‘I am beneficial to the community’ or ‘I am of use to someone’ is the only thing that can give one a true awareness that one has worth. ([Location 2645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2645))
- You are not the one who decides if your contributions are of use. That is the task of other people, and is not an issue in which you can intervene. ([Location 2650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2650))
- all we need is the subjective sense that ‘I am of use to someone’, or in other words, a feeling of contribution. ([Location 2652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2652))
- happiness is the feeling of contribution. ([Location 2655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074TWG8V7&location=2655))
- the reason people seek recognition is clear to you now. People want to like themselves. They want to feel that they have worth.
