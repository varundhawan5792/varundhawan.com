## Highlights
- “The levels below are for people to grow their autonomy; the levels above increase impact and responsibility.” ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=361))
- But titles do matter. The Medium engineering team wrote a blog post that lays out three reasons titles are necessary: “Helping people understand that they are progressing, vesting authority in those people who might not automatically receive it, and communicating an expected competency level to the outside world.” ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=387))
- The local maximum, the best decision for a single group, might not be anything like the best decision when you take a broader view. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=428))
- You get better outcomes and designs if experienced engineers have the time to go deep and build the context and the authority to set the right technical direction. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=461))
- More seasoned engineers can have huge impact by conducting code and design reviews, providing architectural best practices, and creating the kinds of tooling that make everyone faster and safer. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=540))
- engineering norms are set by the behavior of the most respected engineers on the project. No matter what the standards say, if the most senior engineers don’t write tests, you’ll never convince everyone else to do it. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=545))
- Accomplishing larger things means working with larger groups of people—and that needs a wider set of skills. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=575))
- As your compensation increases and your time becomes more and more expensive, the work you do is expected to be more valuable and have a greater impact. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=576))
- Staff engineers often take on ambiguous, messy, difficult problems and do just enough work on them to make them manageable by someone else. Once the problem is tractable, it becomes a growth opportunity for less experienced engineers (sometimes with support from the staff engineer). ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=639))
- At staff+ levels, your manager should be bringing you information and sharing context, but you should be telling them what’s important just as much as the other way around. ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=651))
- The more senior you become, the more you will rely on strong communication skills. Almost everything you do will involve conveying information from your brain to other people’s brains and vice versa. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=674))
- The work that’s most important will often be the work that nobody else sees. It might be a struggle to even articulate the need for it, because your teams don’t have good mental models for it yet. It might involve gathering data that doesn’t exist, or spelunking through dusty code or documents that haven’t been touched in a decade. There are any number of other grungy tasks that just need to get done. Meaningful work comes in many forms. Know why the problem you’re working on is strategically important—and if it’s not, do something else. ([Location 906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=906))
- A technique I learned from my friend Cian Synnott is to write out my understanding of my job and share it with my manager. It can feel a little intimidating to answer the question “What do you do here?” What if other people think what you do is useless, or think you don’t do it well? But writing it out removes the ambiguity, and you’ll find out early if your mental model of the role is the same as everyone else’s. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=926))
- Your job is to make your organization successful. You might be a technology expert or a coder or affiliated with a specific team, but ultimately your job is to help your organization achieve its goals. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=960))
- If you can train your brain to say “That’s interesting!” and remember facts that you might need later on, you’ll start to add detail to your maps and build skills in synthesizing new information. ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=1107))
- If your brain’s not naturally “sticky” for retaining information like this, I recommend challenging yourself to note down facts that might be useful later, just to get yourself into the habit of paying attention. Think of gathering context as a skill to build as part of your job. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=1116))
- You’ll have to convince other people that you’re right and, even more difficult, convince them to care that you’re right. That means knowing how to build momentum within your organization: figuring out who can sponsor your idea or help it spread, and how you can get it over the finish line and make it “real.” ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=1354))
- What’s the culture? Whenever I interview a job candidate, their first question is often, “What’s the culture like?” I used to struggle to answer; where do you even start? Tomes have been written on organizational culture. Now, though, I think most of the time people are really asking these questions: How much autonomy will I have? Will I feel included? Will it be safe to make mistakes? Will I be part of the decisions that affect me? How difficult will it be to make progress on my projects? Are people…you know…nice? ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=1378))
- If you’re struggling to begin a conversation with someone, an easy starting point is to ask a question, take an interest in what they work on, or (genuinely) compliment something you admire about them.7 Most people are interested in talking about their work or their priorities, and most will be happy to explain how something they’re interested in works. Small talk is a learnable skill that will pay dividends throughout your career. (And if you’re talking with someone more junior than you, it’s kind of your responsibility to make it not awkward.)

## New highlights added December 17, 2024 at 7:29 PM
- When you’re choosing a technology to invest in, often that’s because it’s an unavoidable step on the path to something else. You’re not building a new service mesh for the joy of building a service mesh; you’re building it to make your microservices framework easier to use, because you want to make it easy for new services to get set up quickly, because you want teams to be able to ship features faster. The real goal is to reduce time to market. ([Location 1861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=1861))
- It may take you time to dispel the fog of war and uncover the true destination of your journey. Once you do understand it, don’t keep it to yourself. That means telling the story to other people and letting them understand why it matters. Your story should show where you are, where you’re going, and why you’re taking the steps that you are along the way. If there are sea monsters or shortcuts to know, you’ll probably want those ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=1867))
- Nobody wants to delay their project for the sake of a long and painful fight to make a controversial decision or choose a standard. Instead, groups make locally good decisions that solve their own immediate problems. ([Location 2044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=2044))
- values are what you do: the clearest indicator of what the company values is what gets people promoted. No matter how much your organization claims to encourage collaboration and teamwork, that message will be undermined if any staff engineers get to that level through “heroic” solitary efforts. ([Location 5649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5649))
- Being a role model is not always comfortable. But as you become more senior, it’s one of the biggest ways you’ll affect your organization. Like it or not, you’re setting your engineering culture. Take that power seriously. Being a role model doesn’t mean you have to become a public figure, be louder than you’re comfortable with, or throw your weight around. Many of the best leaders are quiet and thoughtful, influencing through good decisions and effective collaboration (and showing fellow quiet people that there’s space for them to lead). ([Location 5658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5658))
- As a staff+ engineer, or any senior person, a big part of your role is to take on things that need to be done and to reliably do them well. Competence includes building (and keeping) knowledge and skills, being self-aware, and having high standards. ([Location 5683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5683))
- skills. You can learn a lot from books, but there’s no substitute for working through problems yourself, learning your own techniques for solving them, and seeing what works and what doesn’t. ([Location 5702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5702))
- The broader your scope of experience, the more “hooks” you’ll have to hang new knowledge off, and the faster you can learn new things. ([Location 5754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5754))
- Be open about what you’re learning, and show how you’re doing it. When you’re making a statement that involves obscure knowledge or a logical leap, fill in the gaps for the folks around you: tell them why you came to the conclusion you did, what information you used, and how you came by that information. Be clear that you’re learning so it’s safe for them to learn too. ([Location 5780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5780))
- A huge part of self-awareness is understanding that you have a perspective, that your context is not the universal context, and that your opinions and knowledge are specific to you. You’ll need to escape your echo chamber every time you talk to teams in other areas or explain technical topics to nonengineers. You’ll know what information you have that they might not, so you can bridge that gap. ([Location 5816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5816))
- It’s much harder to explain something simply! ([Location 5820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5820))
- Look for opportunities to put aside your ego and ask someone else to help make your work better. Ask for code review, design review, and peer evaluations. When you’ve got an idea you love, invite your colleagues to poke holes in it. ([Location 5833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5833))
- when junior people do too much administrative or leadership work and not enough technical work, they’re spending their prime technical learning years in a way that doesn’t teach them technical skills. That can stunt their careers in the long run. But, often, leaders don’t step in: the glue work is needed for the project to succeed, and they’re just glad it’s getting done. ([Location 5934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5934))
- Every time someone apologizes for asking a basic question and there’s a chorus of reassurance from others who insist that it’s actually a good question, culture is built. That’s an environment where it’s easy to learn. ([Location 5988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5988))
- Meeting notes are a great example of glue work. If a junior person is taking notes, they’re unable to participate, and it’s considered low-status administrative work. If a senior person takes notes, they’re making sure the meeting is effective, and everyone’s very impressed! ([Location 5999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=5999))
- Shadowing is a way of teaching by demonstrating: your “shadow” watches you execute a skill and takes notes on how you’re approaching it. It’s a great opportunity to be a visible role model and show your colleague how to work with high standards. ([Location 6656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=6656))
- Finally, you might “reverse shadow,” where the learner performs the task and the experienced person watches and gives notes. ([Location 6661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=6661))
- Be careful, though: a review done wrong can destroy someone’s confidence rather than boosting it. It can be soul-destroying to work through a barrage of comments that are condescending, seem arbitrary, or that you don’t understand. ([Location 6668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=6668))
- Whereas mentoring involves sharing your personal experiences, coaching teaches people to solve problems for themselves. It can be a slower process, but your colleague will learn much more by making their own connections than they will from you giving them the answers. ([Location 6714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=6714))
- good coaching involves drawing out their own best ideas, providing them the space to reflect, and helping them take their own journey to a solution that works for them. ([Location 6736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=6736))
