## Highlights
- “The levels below are for people to grow their autonomy; the levels above increase impact and responsibility.” ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=361))
- But titles do matter. The Medium engineering team wrote a blog post that lays out three reasons titles are necessary: “Helping people understand that they are progressing, vesting authority in those people who might not automatically receive it, and communicating an expected competency level to the outside world.” ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=387))
- The local maximum, the best decision for a single group, might not be anything like the best decision when you take a broader view. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=428))
- You get better outcomes and designs if experienced engineers have the time to go deep and build the context and the authority to set the right technical direction. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=461))
- More seasoned engineers can have huge impact by conducting code and design reviews, providing architectural best practices, and creating the kinds of tooling that make everyone faster and safer. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=540))
- engineering norms are set by the behavior of the most respected engineers on the project. No matter what the standards say, if the most senior engineers don’t write tests, you’ll never convince everyone else to do it. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=545))
- Accomplishing larger things means working with larger groups of people—and that needs a wider set of skills. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=575))
- As your compensation increases and your time becomes more and more expensive, the work you do is expected to be more valuable and have a greater impact. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=576))
- Staff engineers often take on ambiguous, messy, difficult problems and do just enough work on them to make them manageable by someone else. Once the problem is tractable, it becomes a growth opportunity for less experienced engineers (sometimes with support from the staff engineer). ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=639))
- At staff+ levels, your manager should be bringing you information and sharing context, but you should be telling them what’s important just as much as the other way around. ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=651))
- The more senior you become, the more you will rely on strong communication skills. Almost everything you do will involve conveying information from your brain to other people’s brains and vice versa. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=674))
- The work that’s most important will often be the work that nobody else sees. It might be a struggle to even articulate the need for it, because your teams don’t have good mental models for it yet. It might involve gathering data that doesn’t exist, or spelunking through dusty code or documents that haven’t been touched in a decade. There are any number of other grungy tasks that just need to get done. Meaningful work comes in many forms. Know why the problem you’re working on is strategically important—and if it’s not, do something else. ([Location 906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=906))
- A technique I learned from my friend Cian Synnott is to write out my understanding of my job and share it with my manager. It can feel a little intimidating to answer the question “What do you do here?” What if other people think what you do is useless, or think you don’t do it well? But writing it out removes the ambiguity, and you’ll find out early if your mental model of the role is the same as everyone else’s. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=926))
- Your job is to make your organization successful. You might be a technology expert or a coder or affiliated with a specific team, but ultimately your job is to help your organization achieve its goals. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=960))
- If you can train your brain to say “That’s interesting!” and remember facts that you might need later on, you’ll start to add detail to your maps and build skills in synthesizing new information. ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=1107))
- If your brain’s not naturally “sticky” for retaining information like this, I recommend challenging yourself to note down facts that might be useful later, just to get yourself into the habit of paying attention. Think of gathering context as a skill to build as part of your job. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=1116))
- You’ll have to convince other people that you’re right and, even more difficult, convince them to care that you’re right. That means knowing how to build momentum within your organization: figuring out who can sponsor your idea or help it spread, and how you can get it over the finish line and make it “real.” ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=1354))
- What’s the culture? Whenever I interview a job candidate, their first question is often, “What’s the culture like?” I used to struggle to answer; where do you even start? Tomes have been written on organizational culture. Now, though, I think most of the time people are really asking these questions: How much autonomy will I have? Will I feel included? Will it be safe to make mistakes? Will I be part of the decisions that affect me? How difficult will it be to make progress on my projects? Are people…you know…nice? ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=1378))
- If you’re struggling to begin a conversation with someone, an easy starting point is to ask a question, take an interest in what they work on, or (genuinely) compliment something you admire about them.7 Most people are interested in talking about their work or their priorities, and most will be happy to explain how something they’re interested in works. Small talk is a learnable skill that will pay dividends throughout your career. (And if you’re talking with someone more junior than you, it’s kind of your responsibility to make it not awkward.)
