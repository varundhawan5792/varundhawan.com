## Highlights
- • Actions **less than 100 milliseconds** apart will feel simultaneous. If you tap on an icon and, 100ms later, a menu appears, it feels like no time at all passed between the two actions. So, if there’s an animation between the two actions — the menu slides in, for example — the illusion of simultaneity might be broken. For the smallest temporal spaces, animations and transitions can make the app feel *slower*.[3](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/ui-density#fn3)
  • Between **100 milliseconds and 1 second**, the connection between two actions is broken. If you tap on a link and there’s no change for a second, doubt creeps in: did you actually tap on anything? Is the app broken? Is your internet working? Animations and transitions can bridge this perceptual gap. Visual cues in these spaces make the UI feel more dense in time.
  • Gaps between **1 and 10 seconds** can’t be bridged with animations alone; research[4](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/ui-density#fn4) shows that users are most likely to abandon a page within the first 10 seconds. This means that if two actions are far enough apart, a user will leave the page instead of waiting for the second action. If you can’t decrease the time between these actions, show an indeterminate loading indicator — a small animation that tells the user that the system is operating normally.
  • Gaps between **10 seconds and 1 minute** are even harder to fill. After seeing an indeterminate loader for more than 10 seconds, a user is likely to see it as static, not dynamic, and start to assume that the page isn’t working as expected. Instead, you can use a determinate loading indicator — like a larger progress bar — that clearly indicates how much time is left until the next action happens. In fact, the right design can make the waiting time seem shorter than it actually is; the backwards-moving stripes that featured prominently in Apple’s “Aqua” design system made waiting times seem 11% shorter.[5](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/ui-density#fn5)
  • For gaps **longer than 1 minute,** it’s best to let the user leave the page (or otherwise do something else), then notify them when the next action has occurred. Blocking someone from doing anything useful for longer than a minute creates frustration. Plus, long, complex processes are also susceptible to error, which can compound the frustration.
