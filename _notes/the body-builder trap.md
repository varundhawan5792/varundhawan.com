title: The Body-Builder Trap
excerpt: Seeking status to escape inadequacy can reinforce self-doubt
---
When we seek status as a way to escape feelings of “not-enoughness,” we often reinforce the core underlying belief that something is wrong with us.

Take the [example of a bodybuilder](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/56223) who exercises from a place of hating their body and wanting it to change. Even if they do get in shape, this only serves to reinforce the link between body image and self-worth in their mind, leaving them hypersensitive to minor fluctuations in weight and anything that feels like a potential “flaw.”

While exercise may temporarily keep the demons at bay, their sense of worthiness remains fragile. The [smallest imperfection](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-020-01142-z) can bring up self-loathing, turning workouts into a way to punish the body rather than a tool for self-care. 

In the same way, when we chase status as a way to deal with feelings of insecurity, it gives power to those feelings in our lives. The more we focus on climbing the status ladder, the more attuned we become to social rejection and comparisons with others. This takes our focus away from what we truly want in life and instead turns our work into an ego-driven quest for recognition and validation.
