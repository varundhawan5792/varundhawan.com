title: Problem Archetypes
excerpt: We keep solving the same problems over and again
---

Every problem can be reduced to an archetype, a pattern. When you do that, it's quite clear that we keep solving the same problems over and again. 

Some common problem archetypes are:

- Task Management
- Project Management
- Service Request and Delivery
- Setup Wizards
- Marketplaces
